<!-- For PDF output, include these two LaTeX commands after unnumbered chapter headings, otherwise the mini table of contents and the running header will show the previous chapter -->

In this chapter I describe an application of Bayesian spatio-temporal statistics to small-area estimation of HIV risk group proportions.
This work was conducted in collaboration with colleagues from the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis and UNAIDS.
I developed the statistical model, building upon an earlier version of the analysis conducted by Kathryn Risher.
The results are presented in @howes2023spatio.
Kathryn has also created a spreadsheet tool (`https://hivtools.unaids.org/pse/`) using the estimates.
This tool is being used by countries, and continues to be developed.
Code for the analysis in this chapter is available from [`athowes/multi-agyw`](https://github.com/athowes/multi-agyw).

## Background

In SSA, adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) aged 15-29 are a demographic group at increased risk of HIV infection.
Though AGYW are only 28% of the population, they comprise 44% of new infections [@unaids2021update].
HIV incidence for AGYW is 2.4 times higher than for similarly aged males.
The social and biological reasons for this disparity include structural vulnerabilites and power imbalances, age patterns of sexual mixing, younger age at first sex, and increased susceptibility to HIV infection.
On this basis, AGYW have been identified as a priority population for HIV prevention services, and significant investments have been made in prevention programming [@saul2018dreams; @global2018measurement].

The Global AIDS Strategy 2021-2026 [@unaids2021global] was adopted by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in June 2021.
It proposed stratifying HIV prevention packages to AGYW based on 1) local population-level HIV incidence and 2) individual-level sexual risk behaviour.
Risk of acquiring HIV depends on both factors.
As such, prioritisation of prevention services is more efficient if both are taken into account (Figure \@ref(fig:risk-grid)).
The strategy encourages programmes to define targets for the proportion of AGYW to be reached with a range of interventions.
Implementation of the strategy by national HIV programmes and stakeholders requires data on the population size and HIV incidence in each risk group by location.

(ref:risk-grid) Risk of acquiring HIV depends on both individual-level risk behaviour and population-level HIV incidence. I assume that with no individual-level risk behaviour, there is no risk of acquiring HIV, independent of the population-level HIV incidence. This figure is adapted from a presentation I gave for High Impact Medicine, and is intended to be illustrative, rather than interpreted quantitatively.

| Risk group | Description | Incidence rate ratio |
| ---------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| None       | Not sexually active | 0.0 |
| Low        | One cohabiting sexual partner | 1.0 (baseline) |
| High       | Non-regular or multiple partner(s) | 1.72 |
| Very High  | Reporting transactional sex (later adjusted to correspond to FSW) | 3.0-25.0 (varies depending on local HIV incidence) |

Table: (\#tab:risk-groups) HIV risk groups and HIV incidence rate ratios relative to AGYW with one cohabiting sexual partner.
The incidence rate ratio for women with non-regular or multiple sexual partner(s) was derived from analysis of longitudinal data [@slaymaker2020croi].
Among FSW, the incidence rate ratio (25.0, 13.0, 9.0, 6.0, 3.0) depended on the level of HIV incidence among the general population (<0.1\%, 0.1-0.3\%, 0.3-1.0\%, 1.0-3.0\%, >3.0\%), such that higher local HIV incidence in the general population corresponds to a lower incidence rate ratio for FSW.
These estimates were derived by UNAIDS based on patterns of relative HIV prevalence among FSW compared to general population prevalence.

(ref:available-surveys) Surveys conducted 1999-2018 that were used in the analysis by year, survey type, sample size, and whether the survey included a specific question about transactional sex.

```{r available-surveys, fig.cap="(ref:available-surveys)"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0("resources/multi-agyw/", resource_version, "/depends/available-surveys.png"))
```

I used household survey data from 13 countries identified by the GFATM as priority countries for implementation of AGYW HIV prevention: Botswana, Cameroon, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Eswatini, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
Surveys conducted in these countries between 1999 and 2018 in which women were interviewed about their sexual behaviour and sufficient geographic information was available to locate survey clusters to health districts were included.
There were `r total_surveys` suitable surveys (Figure \@ref(fig:available-surveys)), with a total sample size of `r comma(agyw_surveyed)` women aged 15-29 years.
Of the respondents, `r comma(agyw_surveyed_age$Y015_019)` were aged 15-19 years, `r comma(agyw_surveyed_age$Y020_024)` were aged 20-24 years, and `r comma(agyw_surveyed_age$Y025_029)` were aged 25-29 years.
The median number of surveys per country was four, ranging from one in Botswana and South Africa to six in Uganda.
Included surveys comprise Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), AIDS Indicator Surveys (AIS), Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (PHIA) surveys, and the Botswana AIDS Impact Survey 2013 (BAIS).

For each survey, respondents were classified into one of four behavioural risk groups according to reported sexual risk behaviour in the past 12 months.
These risk groups were (Table \@ref(tab:risk-groups)):

1. Not sexually active
2. One cohabiting sexual partner
3. Non-regular or multiple sexual partner(s), and
4. Reporting transactional sex.

In the case of inconsistent responses, women were categorised according to the highest risk group they fell into, ensuring that the categories were mutually exclusive.
Exact survey questions varied slightly across survey types and between survey phases.
Questions captured information about whether the respondent had been sexually active in the past twelve months, and if so how with many partners.
For their three most recent partners, respondents were also asked about the type of partnership.
Possible partnership types included spouse, cohabiting partner, partner not cohabiting with respondent, friend, sex worker, sex work client, and other.
Full survey questions used are provided in Appendix \@ref(survey-questions).

Some surveys included a specific question asking if the respondent had received or given money or gifts for sex in the past twelve months.
In these surveys, 2.64\% of women reported transactional sex.
In surveys without such a question, women almost never (0.01\%) answered that one of their three most recent partners was a sex work client.
As a result of this incomparability, it was not not appropriate to include surveys without a specific transactional sex question when estimating the proportion of the population who engaged in transactional sex.
Of the total `r total_surveys` surveys included in the analysis, `r length(giftsvar_surveys)` had a specific transactional sex question, with a total sample size of `r comma(agyw_surveyed_giftsvar - giftsvar_Y025_029_overcount)` (`r comma(agyw_surveyed_giftsvar_age$Y015_019)` aged 15-19 years, `r comma(agyw_surveyed_giftsvar_age$Y020_024)` aged 20-24 years, and `r comma(agyw_surveyed_giftsvar_age$Y025_029 - giftsvar_Y025_029_overcount)` aged 25-29 years.
There were `r length(giftsvar_exclude_Y025_029)` DHS surveys which excluded women 25-29 from the transactional sex survey question.

I used estimates of population, PLHIV and new HIV infections stratified by district and age group from HIV estimates published by UNAIDS that were developed using the Naomi model [@eaton2021naomi].
The administrative area hierarchy and geographic boundaries I used correspond to those used for health service planning by countries.
Exceptions are Cameroon and Kenya, where I conducted analysis one level higher at the department and county levels, respectively.
I used the most recent 2022 estimates for all countries, apart from Mozambique where, due to data accuracy concerns, I used the 2021 estimates (in which the Cabo Delgado province is excluded due to disruption by conflict).

## Model for risk group proportions

I took a two-stage modelling approach to estimate the four risk group proportions.
Let the four risk groups be indexed by $k \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$, and denote being in either the third or fourth risk group as $k = 3^{+}$.
First, using all the surveys, I used a spatio-temporal multinomial logistic regression model (Section \@ref(st-multinomial)) to estimate the proportion of AGYW in the risk groups $k \in \{1, 2, 3^{+}\}$.
Then, using only those surveys with a specific transactional sex question, I fit a spatial logistic regression model (Section \@ref(s-logistic)) to estimate the proportion of those in the $k = 3^{+}$ risk group that were in the $k = 3$ and $k = 4$ risk groups respectively.

### Spatio-temporal multinomial logistic regression {#st-multinomial}

Let $i \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$ denote districts partitioning the 13 studied AGYW priority countries $c[i] \in \{1, \ldots, 13\}$.
Consider the years 1999-2018 denoted as $t \in \{1, \ldots, T\}$, and age groups $a \in \{\text{15-19}, \text{20-24}, \text{25-29}\}$.
Let $p_{itak} > 0$ with $\sum_{k = 1}^{3^{+}} p_{itak} = 1$, be the probabilities of membership of risk group $k$.

#### Multinomial logistic regression

```{r}
df_3p1_subnational <- readr::read_csv(paste0("resources/multi-agyw/", resource_version, "/depends/df_3p1_subnational.csv"))

#' For justifying how big the model is!
n_district <- length(unique(df_3p1_subnational$area_id))
n_year <- length(1999:2018)
n_age <- length(unique(df_3p1_subnational$age_group))
n_group <- length(unique(df_3p1_subnational$indicator))
```

A standard multinomial logistic regression model [e.g. @gelman2013bayesian] is specified by
\begin{align}
    \mathbf{y}_{ita} &= (y_{ita1}, \ldots, y_{ita3^{+}})^\top \sim \text{Multinomial}(m_{ita}; \, p_{ita1}, \ldots, p_{ita3^{+}}), \\
    \log \left( \frac{p_{itak}}{p_{ita1}} \right) &= \eta_{itak}, \quad k = 2, 3^{+},
\end{align}
where the number in risk group $k$ is $y_{itak}$, the fixed sample size is $m_{ita} = \sum_{k = 1}^{3^{+}} y_{itak}$, and $k = 1$ is chosen as the baseline category.
This model is not an LGM.
I used the multinomial-Poisson transformation to perform inference using the INLA [@rue2009approximate] algorithm via the `R-INLA` package [@martins2013bayesian].
INLA has comparable accuracy and is substantially more computationally tractable than MCMC for GLMMs defined over `r n_district` districts, `r n_year` years, `r n_age` age groups, and `r n_group` risk groups.

#### The multinomial-Poisson transformation

The multinomial-Poisson transformation reframes a given multinomial logistic regression model as an equivalent Poisson log-linear model.
The equivalent model is of the form
\begin{align}
    y_{itak} &\sim \text{Poisson}(\kappa_{itak}), (\#eq:poisson1) \\
    \log(\kappa_{itak}) &= \eta_{itak}. (\#eq:poisson2)
\end{align}
The basis of the transformation is that conditional on their sum Poisson counts are jointly multinomially distributed [@mccullagh1989generalized] as follows
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{y}_{ita} \, | \, m_{ita} \sim \text{Multinomial} \left( m_{ita}; \frac{\kappa_{ita1}}{\kappa_{ita}}, \ldots, \frac{\kappa_{ita3^{+}}}{\kappa_{ita}} \right),
\end{equation}
where $\kappa_{ita} = \sum_{k = 1}^{3^{+}} \kappa_{itak}$.
Category probabilities may then be obtained using the softmax function
\begin{equation}
    p_{itak} = \frac{\exp(\eta_{itak})}{\sum_{k = 1}^{3^{+}} \exp(\eta_{itak})} = \frac{\kappa_{itak}}{\sum_{k = 1}^{3^{+}} \kappa_{itak}} = \frac{\kappa_{itak}}{\kappa_{ita}}.
\end{equation}
Under the equivalent model, the sample sizes $m_{ita}$ are treated as random rather than fixed such that
\begin{equation}
m_{ita} = \sum_k y_{itak} \sim \text{Poisson} \left( \sum_k \kappa_{itak} \right) = \text{Poisson} \left( \kappa_{ita} \right).
\end{equation}
The joint distribution of $p(\mathbf{y}_{ita}, m_{ita}) = p(\mathbf{y}_{ita} \, | \, m_{ita})p(m_{ita})$ is then
\begin{align}
p(\mathbf{y}_{ita}, m_{ita}) &= \exp(-\kappa_{ita}) \frac{(\kappa_{ita})^{m_{ita}}}{m_{ita}!} \times \frac{m_{ita}!}{\prod_k y_{itak}!} \prod_k \left( \frac{\kappa_{itak}}{\kappa_{ita}} \right)^{y_{itak}} \\
&= \prod_k \left( \frac{\exp(-\kappa_{itak}) \left( \kappa_{itak} \right)^{y_{itak}}}{y_{itak}!} \right) \\
&= \prod_k \text{Poisson} \left( y_{itak} \, | \, \kappa_{itak} \right), (\#eq:prodpoisson)
\end{align}
corresponding to the product of independent Poisson likelihoods as in Equation \@ref(eq:poisson1).

The random sample size model is equivalent to a multinomial logistic regression model only when the normalisation constants $m_{ita}$ are recovered exactly.
To ensure that this is the case, observation-specific random effects $\theta_{ita}$ can be included in the equation for the linear predictor.
Multiplying each of $\{\kappa_{itak}\}_{k = 1}^{3^+}$ by $\exp(\theta_{ita})$ has no effect on the category probabilities, but does provide the necessary flexibility for $\kappa_{ita}$ to recover $m_{ita}$ exactly.
Although in theory an improper prior distribution $\theta_{ita} \propto 1$ should be used, I found that in practise, by keeping $\eta_{ita}$ otherwise small using appropriate constraints, so that arbitrarily large values of $\theta_{ita}$ are not required, it is sufficient (and practically preferable for inference) to instead use a vague prior distribution.

#### Model specifications

|    | Category $\beta_k$ | Country $\zeta_{ck}$ | Age $\alpha_{ack}$ | Spatial $\phi_{ik}$ | Temporal $\gamma_{tk}$ |
| -- | ------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| M1 | IID | IID | IID | IID   | IID |
| M2 | IID | IID | IID | Besag | IID |
| M3 | IID | IID | IID | IID   | AR1 |
| M4 | IID | IID | IID | Besag | AR1 |

Table: (\#tab:multinomial-models) Four multinomial regression models were considered. Observation random effects $\theta_{ita}$, included in all models, are omitted from this table.

I considered four models (Table \@ref(tab:multinomial-models)) for $\eta_{ita}$ in the equivalent Poisson log-linear model (Equation \@ref(eq:poisson2)) of the form
\begin{equation}
\eta_{ita} = \theta_{ita} + \beta_k + \zeta_{c[i]k} + \alpha_{ac[i]k} + u_{ik} + \gamma_{tk}.
\end{equation}
<!-- + \delta_{itk} -->
Observation random effects $\theta_{ita} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1000^2)$ with a vague prior distribution were included in all models I considered to ensure the transformation is valid.
To capture country-specific proportion estimates for each category, I included category random effects $\beta_k \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \tau_\beta^{-1})$ and country-category random effects $\zeta_{ck} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \tau_\zeta^{-1})$.
Heterogeneity in risk group proportions by age was allowed by including age-country-category random effects $\alpha_{ack} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \tau_\alpha^{-1})$.

##### Spatial random effects

For the space-category $u_{ik}$ random effects I considered two specifications:

1. Independent and identically distributed (IID) $u_{ik} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \tau_u^{-1})$,
2. Besag [@besag1991bayesian] grouped by category
$$
\mathbf{u} = (u_{11}, \ldots, u_{n1}, \ldots, u_{1{3^{+}}}, \ldots u_{n3^{+}})^\top \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, (\tau_u \mathbf{R}^\star_u)^{-}).
$$
The scaled structure matrix $\mathbf{R}^\star_u = \mathbf{R}^\star_b \otimes \mathbf{I}$ is given by the Kronecker product of the scaled Besag structure matrix $\mathbf{R}^\star_b$ and the identity matrix $\mathbf{I}$, and ${-}$ denotes the generalised matrix inverse.
I followed best practices for the Besag model as described in Chapter \@ref(beyond-borders).

In preliminary testing, I excluded spatial random effects from the model, but found that this negatively effected performance.
I also tested using the BYM2 model [@simpson2017penalising] in place of the Besag, but found that the proportion parameter posteriors tended to be highly peaked at the value one.
For simplicity and to avoid numerical issues, by using Besag random effects I effectively decided to fix this proportion to one.

##### Temporal random effects

For the year-category $\gamma_{tk}$ random effects I considered two specifications:

1. IID $\gamma_{tk} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \tau_\gamma^{-1})$,
2. First order autoregressive (AR1) grouped by category
$$
\boldsymbol{\mathbf{\gamma}} = (\gamma_{11}, \ldots, \gamma_{13^{+}}, \ldots, \gamma_{T1}, \ldots, \gamma_{T3^{+}})^\top \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, (\tau_\gamma \mathbf{R}^\star_\gamma)^{-}).
$$
The scaled structure matrix $\mathbf{R}^\star_\gamma = \mathbf{R}^\star_r \otimes \mathbf{I}$ is given by the Kronecker product of a scaled AR1 structure matrix $\mathbf{R}^\star_r$ and the identity matrix $\mathbf{I}$.
The AR1 structure matrix $\mathbf{R}_r$ is obtained by precision matrix of the random effects $\mathbf{r} = (r_1, \ldots, r_T)^\top$ specified by
\begin{align}
r_1 &\sim \left( 0, \frac{1}{1 - \rho^2} \right), \\
r_t &= \rho r_{t - 1} + \epsilon_t, \quad t = 2, \ldots, T, 
\end{align}
where $\epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ and $|\rho| < 1$.

##### Prior distributions

All random effect precision parameters $\tau \in \{\tau_\beta, \tau_\zeta, \tau_\alpha, \tau_u, \tau_\gamma\}$ were given independent penalised complexity (PC) prior distributions [@simpson2017penalising] with base model $\sigma = 0$ given by
\begin{equation}
p(\tau) = 0.5 \nu \tau^{-3/2} \exp \left( - \nu \tau^{-1/2} \right)
\end{equation}
where $\nu = - \ln(0.01) / 2.5$ such that  $\mathbb{P}(\sigma > 2.5) = 0.01$.
For the lag-one correlation parameter $\rho$, I used the PC prior distribution, as derived by @sorbye2017penalised, with base model $\rho = 1$ and condition $\mathbb{P}(\rho > 0 = 0.75)$.
I chose the base model $\rho = 1$ corresponding to no change in behaviour over time, rather than the alternative $\rho = 0$ corresponding to no correlation in behaviour over time, as I judged the former to be more plausible a priori.

#### Constraints

To faciliate interpretability of the posterior inferences, I applied sum-to-zero constraints such that none of the category interaction random effects altered overall category probabilities.
For the space-year-category random effects, I applied analogous sum-to-zero constraints to maintain roles of the space-category and year-category random effects (Table \@ref(tab:constraints)).

| Random effects | Constraints |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Category       | $\sum_k \beta_k = 0$ |
| Country        | $\sum_c \zeta_{ck} = 0, \, \forall \, k$ |
| Age-country    | $\sum_a \alpha_{ack} = 0, \, \forall \, c, k$ |
| Spatial        | $\sum_i u_{ik} = 0, \, \forall \, k$ |
| Temporal       | $\sum_t \gamma_{tk} = 0, \, \forall \, k$ |

Table: (\#tab:constraints) Applying sum-to-zero constraints to interaction effects ensures that the main effect is not interfered with.

#### Survey weighted likelihood

I accounted survey design using a weighted pseudo-likelihood where the observed counts $y$ are replaced by effective counts $y^\star$, as described in Section \@ref(survey).
These counts may not be integers, and as such the Poisson likelihood given in Equation \@ref(eq:poisson1) is not appropriate.
Instead, I used a generalised Poisson pseudo-likelihood $y^\star \sim \text{xPoisson}(\kappa)$ given by
\begin{equation}
    p(y^\star) = \frac{\kappa^{y^\star}}{\left \lfloor{y^\star!}\right \rfloor } \exp \left(- \kappa \right),
\end{equation}
to extend the Poisson distribution to non-integer weighted counts.
This working likelihood is implemented by `family = "xPoisson"` in `R-INLA`.

#### Model selection

I selected the model including Besag spatial random effects and IID temporal random effects based on the conditional predictive ordinate (CPO) criterion [@pettit1990conditional].
For reference, I also computed the deviance information criterion (DIC) [@spiegelhalter2002bayesian] and widely applicable information criterion (WAIC) [@watanabe2013widely].

### Spatial logistic regression {#s-logistic}

To estimate the proportion of those in the $k = 3^{+}$ risk group that were in the $k = 3$ and $k = 4$ risk groups respectively, I fit logistic regression models of the form
\begin{align}
    y_{ia4} &\sim \text{Binomial} \left( y_{ia3} + y_{ia4}, q_{ia} \right), (\#eq:logistic-regression) \\
    q_{ia} &= \text{logit}^{-1} \left( \eta_{ia} \right), 
\end{align}
where
\begin{equation}
q_{ia} = \frac{p_{ia4}}{p_{ia3} + p_{ia4}} = \frac{p_{ia4}}{p_{ia{3^+}}}.
\end{equation}
This two-step approach allowed all surveys to be included in the multinomial regression model, but only those surveys with a specific transactional sex question to be included in the logistic regression model.
As all such surveys occurred in the years 2013-2018 (Figure \@ref(fig:available-surveys)), I assumed $q_{ia}$ to be constant with respect to time.

#### Model specifications

|    | Intercept $\beta_0$ | Country $\zeta_{c}$ | Age $\alpha_{ac}$ | Spatial $u_{i}$ | Covariates |
| -- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
| L1 | Constant | IID | IID | IID   | None |
| L2 | Constant | IID | IID | Besag | None |
| L3 | Constant | IID | IID | IID   | `cfswever`   |
| L4 | Constant | IID | IID | Besag | `cfswever`   |
| L5 | Constant | IID | IID | IID   | `cfswrecent` |
| L6 | Constant | IID | IID | Besag | `cfswrecent` |

Table: (\#tab:logistic-models) Six logistic regression models were considered. The covariate `cfswever` denotes the proportion of men who have ever paid for sex and `cfswrecent` denotes the proportion of men who have paid for sex in the past 12 months.

I considered six logistic regression models (Table \@ref(tab:logistic-models)).
Each included a constant intercept $\beta_0 \sim \mathcal{N}(-2, 1^2)$, country random effects $\zeta_{c} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \tau_\zeta^{-1})$, and age-country random effects $\alpha_{ac} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \tau_\alpha^{-1})$.
The Gaussian prior distribution on $\beta_0$ placed 95\% prior probability on the range `r 100 * round(plogis(-4), 2)`-`r 100 * round(plogis(0), 2)`\% for the percentage of those with non-regular or multiple partners who report transactional sex.
I considered two specifications (IID, Besag) for the spatial random effects $u_i$.
To aid estimation with sparse data, I also considered national-level covariates for the proportion of men who have paid for sex ever \texttt{cfswever} or in the last twelve months \texttt{cfswrecent} [@hodgins2022population].
For both random effect precision parameters $\tau \in \{\tau_\alpha, \tau_\zeta\}$ I used the PC prior distribution with base model $\sigma = 0$ and $\mathbb{P}(\sigma > 2.5 = 0.01)$.
For both regression parameters $\beta \in \{\beta_\texttt{cfswever}, \beta_\texttt{cfswrecent}\}$ I used the prior distribution $\beta \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 2.5^2)$.

#### Survey weighted likelihood

As with the multinomial regression model, I used survey weighted counts $y^\star$ and sample sizes $m^\star$.
I used a generalised binomial pseudo-likelihood $y^\star \sim \text{xBinomial}(m^\star, q)$ given by
\begin{equation}
    p(y^\star \, | \, m^\star, q) =  \binom{\lfloor m^\star \rfloor}{\lfloor y^\star \rfloor} q^{y^\star} (1 - q)^{m^\star - y^\star}
\end{equation}
to extend the binomial distribution to non-integer weighted counts and sample sizes.
This working likelihood is implemented by `family = "xBinomial"` in `R-INLA`.

I selected the model including Besag spatial effects and `cfswrecent` covariates according to the CPO criterion.
All results, including DIC and WAIC, are presented in Table.
Inclusion of Besag spatial random effects, rather than IID, consistently improved performance.
Benefits from inclusion of covariates were more marginal.
As some countries had no suitable surveys, inclusion of covariate information is favourable such that the estimates in these countries are based on some country-specific data.

### Female sex worker population size adjustment

Having had sex "in return for gifts, cash or anything else in the past 12 months" is not considered sufficient to constitute sex work.
As such, I adjusted the estimates obtained based on the transactional sex survey question to match alternative FSW population size estimates.

@stevens2022estimating used a Bayesian meta-analysis of key population specific data sources to estimate adult (15-49) FSW population size by country.
I disaggregated these estimates by age as follows.
First, I calculated the total sexually debuted population in each age group, by country.
To describe the distribution of age at first sex, I used skew logistic distributions [@nguyen2022trends] with cumulative distribution function given by
\begin{equation}
F(x) = \left(1 + \exp(\kappa_c (\mu_c - x)) \right)^{- \gamma_c},
\end{equation}
where $\kappa_c, \mu_c, \gamma_c > 0$ are country-specific shape, shape and skewness parameters respectively.
Next, I used the assumed $\text{Gamma}(\alpha = 10.4, \beta = 0.36)$ FSW age distribution in South Africa from the Thembisa model [@johnson2020thembisa] to calculate the implied ratio between the number of FSW and the sexually debuted population in each age group.
I assumed the South African ratios were applicable to every country, allowing calculation of the number of FSW by age group in all 13 countries.
The resutling age trends obtained (Figure \@ref(fig:age-disagg-fsw-line)) reflect country-level variation in demographics and age-at-first-sex.

```

### Results

#### Coverage assessment

To assess the calibration of the fitted model, I calculated the quantile $q$ of each observation within the posterior predictive distribution.
For calibrated models, these quantiles, known as probability integral transform (PIT) values [@dawid1984present; @bosse2022scoringutils], should follow a uniform distribution $q \sim \mathcal{U}[0, 1]$.
To generate samples from the posterior predictive distribution, I applied the multinomial likelihood to samples from the latent field, setting the sample size to be the floor of the Kish effective sample size.
Using the PIT values, it is possible to calculate the empirical coverage of all $(1 - \alpha)100$\% equal-tailed posterior predictive credible intervals.
These empirical coverages can be compared to the nominal coverage $(1 - \alpha)$ for each value of $\alpha \in [0, 1]$ to give empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) difference values.
This approach has the advantage of considering all possible confidence values at once.
To test for uniformity, I used the binomial distribution based simultaneous confidence bands for ECDF difference values developed by @sailynoja2021graphical.
I found the only significant deviation from uniformity occurred in the right-hand tail of the one cohabiting partner risk group.
That is to say, the proportion of the PIT values which were greater than 0.95 was significantly more than would be expected under a calibrated model.

In the 20-24 and 25-29 year age groups, the majority of women were either cohabiting or had non-regular or multiple partner(s).
Countries in eastern and central Africa (Cameroon, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe) had a higher proportion of women in these age groups cohabiting (`r dividing_border_above_sexcohab$median`\% [95\% CI `r dividing_border_above_sexcohab$lower`--`r dividing_border_above_sexcohab$upper`\%] compared with `r dividing_border_above_sexnonreg$median`\% [95\% CI `r dividing_border_above_sexnonreg$lower`--`r dividing_border_above_sexnonreg$upper`\%] with non-regular partner[s]).
In contrast, countries in southern Africa (Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia and South Africa) had a higher proportion with non-regular or multiple partner(s) (`r dividing_border_below_sexnonreg$median`\% [95\% CI `r dividing_border_below_sexnonreg$lower`--`r dividing_border_below_sexnonreg$upper`\%], compared with `r dividing_border_below_sexcohab$median`\% [95\% CI `r dividing_border_below_sexcohab$lower`--`r dividing_border_below_sexcohab$upper`\%] cohabiting).
This clear geographic delineation passes along the border of Mozambique, through the interior of Zimbabwe and along the border of Zambia (Figure \@ref(fig:3p1-continental-map)).

In most districts (`r round(district_Y015_019_nosex12m_quantiles$median, 1)`\%; 95\% credible interval [CI] `r round(district_Y015_019_nosex12m_quantiles$lower, 1)`--`r round(district_Y015_019_nosex12m_quantiles$upper, 1)`) adolescent girls aged 15-19 were not sexually active.
The exception was Mozambique, where the majority (`r 100 - round(moz_Y015_019_nosex12m$estimate_smoothed, 2)`\%) were sexually active in the past year and close to a third (`r round(moz_Y015_019_sexcohab$estimate_smoothed, 2)`\%) were cohabiting with a partner.

knitr::include_graphics(paste0("resources/multi-agyw/", resource_version, "/depends/aaa-variance-proportions.png"))
```

```{r}
variance_proportions <- readr::read_csv(paste0("resources/multi-agyw/", resource_version, "/depends/variance-proportions-uncertainty.csv"))
variance_proportions_age <- 100 * filter(variance_proportions, variable == "age") %>% select(-variable) %>% round(digits = 3)
variance_proportions_iso3 <- 100 * filter(variance_proportions, variable == "iso3") %>% select(-variable) %>% round(digits = 3)

variance_proportions_cat <- 100 * filter(variance_proportions, variable == "cat") %>% select(-variable) %>% round(digits = 3)
```

Age group was the most important factor explaining variation in risk group proportions, accounting for `r variance_proportions_age$mean`\% (95\% CI `r variance_proportions_age$lower`--`r variance_proportions_age$upper`\%) of total variation.
The primary change in risk group proportions by age group occurs between the 15-19 age group and 20-29 age group (Figure \@ref(fig:3p1-continental-map)).
The next most important factor was location.
Country-level differences explained `r variance_proportions_iso3$mean`\% (95\% CI `r variance_proportions_iso3$lower`--`r variance_proportions_iso3$upper`\%) of variation, while district-level variation within countries explained `r variance_proportions_area$mean`\% (95\% CI `r variance_proportions_area$lower`--`r variance_proportions_area$upper`\%).
<!-- Can I plot the country-level and district-level random effects to visualise this? -->
Temporal changes only explained `r variance_proportions_year$mean`\% (95\% CI `r variance_proportions_year$lower`--`r variance_proportions_year$upper`\%) of variation, indicating very little change in risk group proportions over time.
I found similar variance decomposition results fitting each country individually (Figure \@ref(fig:aaa-variance-proportions)) and using other model specifications.

## Prevalence and incidence by risk group

### Disaggregation of Naomi estimates

I calculated HIV incidence $\lambda_{iak}$ and number of new HIV infections $I_{iak}$ stratified according to district, age group and risk group by linear disaggregation
\begin{align}
    I_{ia} &= \sum_k I_{iak} = \sum_k \lambda_{iak}N_{iak} \\
    &= 0 + \lambda_{ia2} N_{ia2} + \lambda_{ia3} N_{ia3} + \lambda_{ia4} N_{ia4} \\
    &= \lambda_{ia2} \left(N_{ia2}  + \text{RR}_{3} N_{ia3} + \text{RR}_4(\lambda_{ia}) N_{ia4}  \right).
\end{align}
Risk group specific HIV incidence estimates are then given by
\begin{align}
    \lambda_{ia1} &= 0, \\
    \lambda_{ia2} &= I_{ia} / \left(N_{ia2} + \text{RR}_{3} N_{ia3} + \text{RR}_4(\lambda_{ia}) N_{ia4}\right), \\
    \lambda_{ia3} &= \text{RR}_{3} \lambda_{ia2}, \\
    \lambda_{ia4} &= \text{RR}_4(\lambda_{ia}) \lambda_{ia2}.
\end{align}
which I evaluated using Naomi model estimates of the number of new HIV infections $I_{ia} = \lambda_{ia} N_{ia}$, HIV infection risk ratios $\{\text{RR}_3, \text{RR}_4(\lambda_{ia})\}$, and risk group population sizes as above.
The risk ratio $\text{RR}_4(\lambda_{ia})$ was defined as a function of general population incidence.
The number of new HIV infections are then $I_{iak} = \lambda_{iak} N_{iak}$.

### Expected new infections reached

I calculated the number of new infections that would be reached prioritising according to each possible stratification of the population--that is for all $2^3 = 8$ possible combinations of stratification by location, age, and risk group. 
As an illustration, for stratification just by age, I aggregated the number of new HIV infections and HIV incidence as such 
\begin{align}
    I_a &= \sum_{ik} I_{iak}, \\
    \lambda_a &= I_a / \sum_{ik} N_{iak}.
\end{align}
Under this stratification, individuals in each age group $a$ are prioritised according to the highest HIV incidence $\lambda_a$.
By cumulatively summing the expected infections, for each fraction of the total population reached I calculated the fraction of total expected new infections that would be reached.

For any given fraction of AGYW prioritised, substantially more new infections were reached by strategies that included behavioural risk stratification.
Reaching half of all expected new infections required reaching `r inf_half_without_behaviour`\% of the population when stratifying by subnational area and age, but only `r inf_half_with_behaviour`\% when behavioural stratification was included (Figure \@ref(fig:infections-reached)).
The majority of this benefit came from reaching FSW, who were `r inf_fsw$prop_population_cumulative`\% of the population but `r inf_fsw$prop_infections_averted_cumulative`\% of all new infections.

<!-- Possible TODO: How does this vary by country / region?  Maybe worth calling out result for West Africa vs. East Africa vs. Southern Africa here to highlight the difference. Also how does this compare with other estimates? And what does Oli think about this? I recognize that comparison is not straightforward because age group difference! -->

Considering each country separately, on average, reaching half of new infections in each country required reaching `r inf_country_half_without_behaviour$median`\% (range `r inf_country_half_without_behaviour$min`-`r inf_country_half_without_behaviour$max`\%) of the population when stratifying by area and age, reducing to `r inf_country_half_with_behaviour$median`\% (range `r inf_country_half_with_behaviour$min`-`r inf_country_half_with_behaviour$max`\%) when behaviour was included.
The relative importance of stratifying by age, location and behaviour varied between countries, analogous to the varying contribution of each to the total variance (Section \@ref(variance-decomposition)).

## Discussion

In this chapter, I estimated the proportion of AGYW who fall into different risk groups at a district level in 13 sub-Saharan African countries.
These estimates support consideration of differentiated prevention programming according to geographic locations and risk behaviour, as outlined in the Global AIDS Strategy.
Systematic differences in risk by age groups, and variation within and between countries, explained the large majority of variation in risk group proportions.
Changes over time were negligible in the overall variation in risk group proportions.
The proportion of 15-19 year olds who are sexually active, and among women aged 20-29 years, norms around cohabitation especially varied across districts and countries.
This variation underscores the need for these granular data to implement HIV prevention options aligned to local norms and risk behaviours.

I considered four risk groups based on sexual behaviour, the most proximal determinant of risk.
Other factors, such as condom usage or type of sexual act, may account for additional heterogeneity in risk from sexual behaviour.
However, I did not include these factors in view of measurement difficulties, concerns about consistency across contexts, and the operational benefits of describing risk parsimoniously.

Sexual behaviour confers risk only when AGYW reside in geographic locations where there is unsuppressed viral load among their potential partners.
I did not include more distal determinants, such as school attendance, orphanhood, or gender empowerment, as I expect their effects on risk to largely be mediated by more proximal determinants.
However, to effectively implement programming, it is crucial to understand these factors, as well as the broader structural barriers and limits to personal agency faced by AGYW.
Importantly, programs must ensure that intervention prioritisation occurs without stigmatising or blaming AGYW.

By considering a range of possible risk stratification strategies, I showed that successful implementation of a risk-stratified approach would allow substantially more of those at risk for infections to be identified before infection occurs.
A considerable proportion of estimated new infections were among FSW, supporting the case for HIV programming efforts focused on key population groups [@baral2012burden].
There is substantial variation in the importance of prioritisation by age, location and behaviour within each country.
This highlights the importance of understanding and tailoring HIV prevention efforts to country-specific contexts.
By standardising the analysis across all 13 countries, I showed the additional efficiency benefits of resource allocation between countries.

I found a geographic delineation in the proportion of women cohabiting between southern and eastern Africa, calling attention to a divide attributable to many cultural, social, and economic factors.
The delineation does not represent a boundary between predominately Christian and Muslim populations, which is further north.
I also note that the high numbers of adolescent girls aged 15-19 cohabiting in Mozambique is markedly different from the other countries [@unicef].

@brugh2021characterizing previously geographically mapped AGYW HIV risk groups using biomarker and behavioural data from the most recent surveys in Eswatini, Haiti and Mozambique to define and subsequently map risk groups with a range of machine learning techniques.
My work builds on @brugh2021characterizing by including more countries, integrating a greater number of surveys, and connecting risk group proportions with HIV epidemic indicators to help inform programming.

My modelled estimates of risk group proportions improve upon direct survey results for three reasons.
First, by taking a modular modelling approach, I integrated all relevant survey information from multiple years, allowing estimation of the FSW proportion for surveys without a specific transactional sex question.
Second, whereas direct estimates exhibit large sampling variability at a district level, I alleviated this issue using spatio-temporal smoothing (Figure \@ref(fig:model-direct-benefits)).
Third, I provided estimates in all district-years, including those not directly sampled by surveys, allowing estimates to be consistently fed into further analysis and planning pipelines such as my analysis of risk group specific prevalence and incidence (Figure \@ref(fig:model-direct-benefits)).

(ref:model-direct-benefits) Figure caption.

```{r model-direct-benefits, fig.cap="(ref:model-direct-benefits)"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0("resources/multi-agyw/", resource_version, "/depends/model-direct-benefits.png"))
```

The final surveys included in the risk model model were conducted in 2018.
The analysis may be updated with more surveys as they become available.
I do not anticipate that the risk group proportions will change substantially, as I found that they did not change significantly over time.

My analysis focused on females aged 15-29 years, and could be extended to consider optimisation of prevention more broadly, accounting for the `r 100 - 100`\% of new infections among adults 15-49 which occur in women 30-49 and men 15-49.
Estimating sexual risk behaviour in adults 15-49 would be a crucial step toward greater understanding of the dynamics of the HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa, and would allow incidence models to include stratification of individuals by sexual risk.

<!-- Phylogenetic results from BDI are about transmission rather than incidence. -->
<!-- Only age-sex structured not age-sex-behaviour. -->
<!-- Does not undermine my work. -->

### Limitations

This analysis was subject to challenges shared by most approaches to monitoring sexual behaviour in the general population [@cleland2004monitoring].
In particular, under-reporting of higher risk sexual behaviours among AGYW could affect the validity of my risk group proportion estimates.
Due to social stigma or disapproval, respondents may be reluctant to report non-marital partners [@nnko2004secretive; @helleringer2011reliability] or may bias their reporting of sexual debut [@zaba2004age; @wringe2009comparative; @nguyen2022trends].
For guidance of resource allocation, differing rates of under-reporting by country, district, year or age group are particularly concerning to the applicability of my results; and, while it may be reasonable to assume a constant rate over space-time, the same cannot be said for age, where aspects of under-reporting have been shown to decline as respondents age [@glynn2011assessing], suggesting that the elevated risks I found faced by younger women are likely a conservative estimate.
If present, these reporting biases will also have distorted the estimates of infection risk ratios and prevalence ratios I used in my analysis, likely over-attributing risk to higher risk groups.

I have the least confidence in my estimates for the FSW risk group.
As well as having the smallest sample sizes, my transactional sex estimates do not overcome the difficulties of sampling hard to reach groups.
I inherent any limitations of the national FSW estimates [@stevens2022estimating] which I adjust my estimates of transactional sex to match.
Furthermore, I do not consider seasonal migration patterns, which may particularly affect FSW population size.
More generally, I did not consider covariates potentially predictive of risk group proportions (such as sociodemographic characteristics, education, local economic activity, cultural and religious norms and attitudes), which are typically difficult to measure spatially.
Identifying measurable correlates of risk, or particular settings in which time-concentrated HIV risk occurs, is an important area for further research to improve risk prioritisation and precision HIV programme delivery.

The efficiency of each stratified prevention strategy depends on the ability of programmes to identify and effectively reach those in each strata.
My analysis of new infections potentially averted assumed a "best-case" scenario where AGYW of every strata can be reached perfectly, and should therefore be interpreted as illustrating the potentially obtainable benefits rather than benefits which would be obtained from any specific intervention strategy.
In practice, stratified prevention strategies are likely to be substantially less efficient than this best-case scenario.
Factors I did not consider include the greater administrative burden of more complex strategies, variation in difficulty or feasibility of reaching individuals in each strata, variation in the range or effectiveness of interventions by strata, and changes in strata membership that may occur during the course of a year.
Identifying and reaching behavioural strata may be particularly challenging.
Empirical evaluations of behavioural risk screening tools have found only moderate discriminatory ability [@jia2022risk], and risk behaviour may change rapidly among young populations, increasing the challenge to effectively deliver appropriately timed prevention packages.
This consideration may motivate selecting risk groups based on easily observable attributes, such as attendance of a particular service or facility, rather than sexual behaviour.

In conducting this work, there was insufficient engagement with country experts or civil society organisations.
As a result, in early use of the risk group tool the FSW population size estimates were met with some disagreement in Malawi.
In that instance, the cause of the disagreement was extenal model inputs used.
In future, estimates should be generated and reviewed by country teams.

<!-- RE notes that it could be worth talking about the age patterns of sexual mixing, that I didn't consider them, and how they might effect intervention planning. -->

### Conclusion

I estimated HIV risk group proportions, HIV prevalences and HIV incidences for AGYW aged 15-19, 20-24 and 25-29 years at a district-level in 13 priority countries.
Using these estimates, I analyzed the number of infections that could be reached by prioritisation based upon location, age and behaviour.
Though subject to limitations, these estimates provide data that national HIV programmes can use to set targets and implement differentiated HIV prevention strategies as outlined in the Global AIDS Strategy.
Successfully implementing this approach would result in more efficiently reaching a greater number of those at risk of infection.

Among AGYW, there was systematic variation in sexual behaviour by age and location, but not over time.
Age group variation was primarily attributable to age of sexual debut (ages 15-24).
Spatial variation was particularly present between those who reported one cohabiting partner versus non-regular or multiple partners.
Risk group proportions did not change substantially over time, indicating that norms relating to sexual behaviour are relatively static.
These findings underscore the importance of providing effective HIV prevention options tailored to the needs of particular age groups, as well as local norms around sexual partnerships.
