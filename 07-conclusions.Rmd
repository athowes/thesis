Finally, this thesis is concluded by discussing its most important contributions and limitations, as well as avenues for future work and broader conclusions.

## Contributions

This section discusses the contributions made by each chapter of this thesis in turn.

Chapter \@ref(beyond-borders) conducted experiments to comprehensively compare models for spatial structure, using appropriate tools for model assessment such as proper scoring rules and posterior predictive checks.

Chapter \@ref(multi-agyw) estimated HIV risk group proportions for AGYW, facilitating countries in SSA to prioritise their delivery of HIV prevention services.
The number of new infections that might be reached under a variety of risk stratification strategies were also analyzed.
The `R-INLA` software was used to specify multinomial spatio-temporal models via the Poisson-multinomial transformation, including complex two- and three-way Kronecker product interactions.

Chapter \@ref(naomi-aghq) developed a novel Bayesian inference method, motivated by a challenging and practically important problem in HIV surveillance.

## Limitations

The most important limitations of the work done in this thesis are as follows.

## Future work

Promising avenues for future work include:

* Extending the risk group model described in Chapter \@ref(multi-agyw) to include all adults 15-49.
This could involve modelling of age-stratified sexual partnerships [@wolock2021evaluating].
Such a model would likely fall out of the scope of `R-INLA`, but would be possible to write with `TMB` and therefore amenable to the methods advanced in Chapter \@ref(naomi-aghq).

## Conclusions

I am uncertain about this direct impact of this work.
The methodological contributions of Chapters \@ref(beyond-borders) and \@ref(naomi-aghq) could eventually lead to at best marginally more accurate indicator estimates.
It is hard not to see these improvements as relatively inconsequential within the broader context of the HIV response and the challenges posed to it.

Applied modelling and methodological research using complex data often pushes on the boundaries of the available statistical toolkit.
During this research, I encountered difficulties trying to compare models implemented using different statistical tools.
Similarly, I found it challenging, if not impossible, to implement precisely same model using different tooling, leading to conflation of models and inference methodologies.
As the frequently asked questions section of the `R-INLA` website [@rinla2023faq] notes, "the devil is in the details".
Ultimately, I resolved these difficulties by implementing all models in Chapters \@ref(beyond-borders) and \@ref(naomi-aghq) using `TMB` model templates.
(And indeed for future development, I would recommend the model used in Chapters \@ref(multi-agyw) is implemented using `TMB`).
`TMB` was sufficiently flexible to meet the requirements I had.
The benefits of such an ecosystem of packages built using `TMB` are noted by @stringer2021fields.
I would particularly highlight the benefit of enabling analysts to easily vary their choice of inference method based on the stage of model development that they are in.

To the best of my abilities, this thesis, and the work described within it, was written in keeping with the principles of open science.
I hope that doing so allows my work to be appropriately scrutinised, and optimistically built upon.
This would not have been possible without a range of tools from the R ecosystem such as `rmarkdown` and `rticles` for reporting, `devtools` for R package development.
I also used tools written by software engineers within the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis such as `orderly` and `didehpc`.
