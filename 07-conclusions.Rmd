To conclude the thesis, this chapter discusses in turn its most important contributions and limitations, the most promising avenues for future work, and broader reflections about the work.

## Contributions

Chapter \@ref(beyond-borders) used tools for model assessment such as proper scoring rules and posterior predictive checks to comprehensively compare models for spatial structure.
Useful data for practitioners.
Useful to base methodological developments on.

Chapter \@ref(multi-agyw) estimated HIV risk group proportions for AGYW to enable implementation of the Global AIDS strategy.
The risk group proportions were used to disaggregate HIV prevalence and incidence estimates by behaviour, and assess the benefits of a variety of risk stratification strategies.
Estimates from this work are the basis for a tool used to prioritise delivery of HIV prevention services by countries in SSA.
The tool is to be updated by UNAIDS as a part of the annual HIV estimates process.
Alongside this applied contribution, Chapter \@ref(multi-agyw) exemplified specification of complex multinomial spatio-temporal models in `R-INLA` using the Poisson-multinomial transformation.

Chapter \@ref(naomi-aghq) developed deterministic Bayesian inference methods, motivated by a challenging and practically important problem in evidene synthesis for small-area estimation of HIV indicators.
Its most important contributions are two-fold.
First, an implementation of INLA which is compatible with any model specified using a `TMB` C++ template.
Second, a quadrature rule which naturally extends the applicability of INLA methods to moderate hyperparameter dimension.

## Limitations

The most important limitations of the work done in this thesis are as follows.

1. In conducting Chapters \@ref(beyond-borders) and \@ref(naomi-aghq) too little effort was dedicated to understanding the theoretical properties of methods, in favour of empirical computational work.

2. In working most tangibly with real world data, Chapter \@ref(multi-agyw) inherits a wide range of limitations.
To highlight a few:
the external validity of risk ratios derived from cohort studies across all settings.

## Future work

Promising avenues for future work that I would prioritise include:

1. Although AGYW are disproportionately at risk of HIV infection, 56% of new infections still occur in other demographic groups.
As such, it would be valuable to extend the risk group model developed in Chapter \@ref(multi-agyw) to include all adults 15-49.
This might involve modelling of age-stratified sexual partnerships [@wolock2021evaluating].
Such a model would likely fall out of the scope of `R-INLA`, but would be possible to write with `TMB` and therefore amenable to the inference methods advanced in Chapter \@ref(naomi-aghq).

2. For practical use of the INLA implementation developed in Chapter \@ref(naomi-aghq) it is crucial that the speed and usability are improved.
The most important speed improvement would likely come from using the simplified approximation to the Laplace marginals developed by @wood2020simplified.
Usability would be enhanced greatly by integrating the methods into statistical software, first and foremost via the `aghq` package.
The primary difficulty, as it appears now, which would have to be overcome is that the `random` argument of `TMB::MakeADFun` does not allow indexing.

3. The universal INLA implementation developed in Chapter \@ref(naomi-aghq) is enabling of methodological research.
For example, INLA-like methods can now be tested for a broader class of models, such as the Loa loa and Naomi ELGMs (Sections \@ref(loaloa) and \@ref(malawi)).
For this purpose, it is particularly important that the `TMB` C++ template for the log-posterior supports inference using multiple methods, including gold-standard NUTS via `tmbstan`.
In complement to empirical computational work, unabridged specification of the algorithm used for inference could enable theoretical work.

## Broader reflections

I found conducting the work in this thesis tested the boundaries of available statistical software.
For example, I found it challenging, if not impossible, to implement a common model in different software for inference.
As the frequently asked questions section of the `R-INLA` website [@rinla2023faq] notes: "the devil is in the details".
Similarly, I encountered difficulties implementing a desired range of different models in a common software for inference.
These difficulties resulted in conflation of statistical models and inference methodologies, limiting the validity of any findings.
Ultimately, I resolved these issues by implementing all models in Chapters \@ref(beyond-borders) and \@ref(naomi-aghq) using `TMB` model templates.
(I would recommend implementing the model used in Chapter \@ref(multi-agyw) in `TMB` for future development.)
Alongside being sufficiently flexible to meet my model specification requirements, `TMB` is compatible with a range of inference methodologies.
As such, it remains [@osgood2023statistical] an under-rated statistical tool.

There are various paths to impact for the work in this thesis.
First, the methodological contributions of Chapters \@ref(beyond-borders) and \@ref(naomi-aghq) could eventually lead to marginally more accurate indicator estimates.
However, in the broader context of the  of the HIV response effectiveness these improvements seem of limited consequence.
The applied contributions of Chapter \@ref(multi-agyw) have a more promising case for direct impact.

This thesis, and the work described within it, was written in keeping with the principles of open science to the best of my abilities.
I hope doing so facilitates my work to be scrutinised, and more optimistically, built upon.
This was made possible tools from the R ecosystem such as `rmarkdown` and `rticles` for reporting, `devtools` for R package development, as well as those written by software engineers within the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis such as `orderly` and `didehpc`.
