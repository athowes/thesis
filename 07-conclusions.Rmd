## Strengths

* Chapter \@ref(beyond-borders) conducted thorough experiments to compare models for spatial structure using tools for model assessment such as proper scoring rules and posterior predictive checks.

* Chapter \@ref(multi-agyw) estimated HIV risk group proportions for AGYW, facilitating countries in SSA to prioritise their delivery of HIV prevention services.
The number of new infections that might be reached under a variety of risk stratification strategies were analyzed.
The `R-INLA` software was used to specify multinomial spatio-temporal models via the Poisson-multinomial transformation, including complex two- and three-way Kronecker product interactions.

* Chapter \@ref(naomi-aghq) developed a novel Bayesian inference method, motivated by a challenging and practically important problem in HIV surveillance.

## Weaknesses

## Future work

Avenues for future work include:

* Extending the risk group model described in Chapter \@ref(multi-agyw) to include all adults 15-49. This may involve modelling of age-stratified sexual partnerships [@wolock2021evaluating].
Such a model would likely fall out of the scope of `R-INLA`, but would be possible to write with `TMB` and therefore amenable to the methods discussed in Chapter \@ref(naomi-aghq).

## Conclusions

* Modelling complex data often pushes on the boundaries of the available statistical toolkit.

* A challenge encountered while conducting this research was the difficulty of implementing identical models across multiple frameworks, looking to study inference methods. Or, of a similarly fraught nature, comparing different models implemented in different frameworks, looking to study model differences. The frequently asked questions section of the `R-INLA` website [@rinla2023faq] notes that "the devil is in the details". I have resolved this challenge by using a given `TMB` model template to fit models using multiple inference methodologies. The benefits of such a ecosystem of packages are noted by @stringer2021fields. I particularly highlight the benefit of enabling analysts to easily vary their choice of inference method based on the stage of model development that they are in.

* To the best of my abilities, this thesis, and the work described within it, was written in keeping with the principles of open science.
I hope that doing so allows my work to be scrutinised, and optimistically built upon.
This would not have been possible without a range of tools from the R ecosystem such as `rmarkdown` and `rticles`, as well as those developed within the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis such as `orderly` and `didehpc`.
