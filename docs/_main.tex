% John tried to comment this file extensively, so read through it to see how to use the various options.  Remember
% that in LaTeX, any line starting with a % is NOT executed.  Several places below, you have a choice of which line to use
% out of multiple options (eg draft vs final, for PDF vs for binding, etc.)  When you pick one, add a % to the beginning of
% the lines you don't want.


%%%%% CHOOSE PAGE LAYOUT
% The most common choices should be below.  You can also do other things, like replacing "a4paper" with "letterpaper", etc.

% This one will format for two-sided binding (ie left and right pages have mirror margins; blank pages inserted where needed):
%\documentclass[a4paper,twoside]{templates/ociamthesis}
% This one will format for one-sided binding (ie left margin > right margin; no extra blank pages):
%\documentclass[a4paper]{ociamthesis}
% This one will format for PDF output (ie equal margins, no extra blank pages):
%\documentclass[a4paper,nobind]{templates/ociamthesis}

%%%%% SELECT YOUR DRAFT OPTIONS
% This adds a "DRAFT" footer to every normal page.  (The first page of each chapter is not a "normal" page.)

% This highlights (in blue) corrections marked with (for words) \mccorrect{blah} or (for whole
% paragraphs) \begin{mccorrection} . . . \end{mccorrection}.  This can be useful for sending a PDF of
% your corrected thesis to your examiners for review.  Turn it off, and the blue disappears.
\correctionstrue

%%%%% BIBLIOGRAPHY SETUP
% Note that your bibliography will require some tweaking depending on your department, preferred format, etc.
% If you've not used LaTeX before, I recommend reading a little about biblatex/biber and getting started with it.
% If you're already a LaTeX pro and are used to natbib or something, modify as necessary.
% Either way, you'll have to choose and configure an appropriate bibliography format...



\usepackage{natbib}
\setcitestyle{authoryear}
\bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
\addto\captionsenglish{%
  \renewcommand{\bibname}{Works Cited}
}

% This makes the bibliography left-aligned (not 'justified') and slightly smaller font.
\renewcommand*{\bibfont}{\raggedright\small}


% Uncomment this if you want equation numbers per section (2.3.12), instead of per chapter (2.18):
%\numberwithin{equation}{subsection}


%%%%% THESIS / TITLE PAGE INFORMATION
% Everybody needs to complete the following:
\title{Targeted HIV intervention with Bayesian spatio-temporal statistics}
\author{Adam Howes}
\college{}

% Master's candidates who require the alternate title page (with candidate number and word count)
% must also un-comment and complete the following three lines:

% Uncomment the following line if your degree also includes exams (eg most masters):
%\renewcommand{\submittedtext}{Submitted in partial completion of the}
% Your full degree name.  (But remember that DPhils aren't "in" anything.  They're just DPhils.)
\degree{Doctor of Philosophy}
% Term and year of submission, or date if your board requires (eg most masters)
\degreedate{2023}


%%%%% YOUR OWN PERSONAL MACROS
% This is a good place to dump your own LaTeX macros as they come up.

% To make text superscripts shortcuts
	\renewcommand{\th}{\textsuperscript{th}} % ex: I won 4\th place
	\newcommand{\nd}{\textsuperscript{nd}}
	\renewcommand{\st}{\textsuperscript{st}}
	\newcommand{\rd}{\textsuperscript{rd}}

%%%%% THE ACTUAL DOCUMENT STARTS HERE
\begin{document}

%%%%% CHOOSE YOUR LINE SPACING HERE
% This is the official option.  Use it for your submission copy and library copy:
\setlength{\textbaselineskip}{22pt plus2pt}
% This is closer spacing (about 1.5-spaced) that you might prefer for your personal copies:
%\setlength{\textbaselineskip}{18pt plus2pt minus1pt}

% You can set the spacing here for the roman-numbered pages (acknowledgements, table of contents, etc.)
\setlength{\frontmatterbaselineskip}{17pt plus1pt minus1pt}

% UL: You can set the line and paragraph spacing here for the separate abstract page to be handed in to Examination schools
\setlength{\abstractseparatelineskip}{13pt plus1pt minus1pt}
\setlength{\abstractseparateparskip}{0pt plus 1pt}

% UL: You can set the general paragraph spacing here - I've set it to 2pt (was 0) so
% it's less claustrophobic
\setlength{\parskip}{2pt plus 1pt}

% Oxford University logo on title page

\def\crest{{\includegraphics{templates/ic.pdf}}}
\renewcommand{\university}{Imperial College London}
\renewcommand{\submittedtext}{A thesis submitted for the degree of}


% Leave this line alone; it gets things started for the real document.
\setlength{\baselineskip}{\textbaselineskip}


%%%%% CHOOSE YOUR SECTION NUMBERING DEPTH HERE
% You have two choices.  First, how far down are sections numbered?  (Below that, they're named but
% don't get numbers.)  Second, what level of section appears in the table of contents?  These don't have
% to match: you can have numbered sections that don't show up in the ToC, or unnumbered sections that
% do.  Throughout, 0 = chapter; 1 = section; 2 = subsection; 3 = subsubsection, 4 = paragraph...

% The level that gets a number:
\setcounter{secnumdepth}{2}
% The level that shows up in the ToC:
\setcounter{tocdepth}{1}


%%%%% ABSTRACT SEPARATE
% This is used to create the separate, one-page abstract that you are required to hand into the Exam
% Schools.  You can comment it out to generate a PDF for printing or whatnot.
\begin{abstractseparate}
  Empty
\end{abstractseparate}

% JEM: Pages are roman numbered from here, though page numbers are invisible until ToC.  This is in
% keeping with most typesetting conventions.
\begin{romanpages}

% Title page is created here
\maketitle

%%%%% DEDICATION -- If you'd like one, un-comment the following.
\begin{dedication}
  For Yihui Xie
\end{dedication}

%%%%% ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS -- Nothing to do here except comment out if you don't want it.
\begin{acknowledgements}
 	Thanks!

\begin{flushright}
Adam Howes \\
Imperial College London\\
2023
\end{flushright}
\end{acknowledgements}


%%%%% ABSTRACT -- Nothing to do here except comment out if you don't want it.
\begin{abstract}
	Empty
\end{abstract}

%%%%% MINI TABLES
% This lays the groundwork for per-chapter, mini tables of contents.  Comment the following line
% (and remove \minitoc from the chapter files) if you don't want this.  Un-comment either of the
% next two lines if you want a per-chapter list of figures or tables.
  \dominitoc % include a mini table of contents

% This aligns the bottom of the text of each page.  It generally makes things look better.
\flushbottom

% This is where the whole-document ToC appears:
\tableofcontents

\listoffigures
	\mtcaddchapter
  	% \mtcaddchapter is needed when adding a non-chapter (but chapter-like) entity to avoid confusing minitoc

% Uncomment to generate a list of tables:
\listoftables
  \mtcaddchapter
%%%%% LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS
% This example includes a list of abbreviations.  Look at text/abbreviations.tex to see how that file is
% formatted.  The template can handle any kind of list though, so this might be a good place for a
% glossary, etc.
\include{front-and-back-matter/abbreviations}

% The Roman pages, like the Roman Empire, must come to its inevitable close.
\end{romanpages}

%%%%% CHAPTERS
% Add or remove any chapters you'd like here, by file name (excluding '.tex'):
\flushbottom

% all your chapters and appendices will appear here
\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\chapter*{Introduction}\label{introduction}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction}

\adjustmtc
\markboth{Introduction}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  How does the ecological fallacy relate to aggregated output models: spatial aggregation and the ecological fallacy
\end{itemize}

\startappendices

\hypertarget{the-first-appendix}{%
\chapter{The First Appendix}\label{the-first-appendix}}


%%%%% REFERENCES

% JEM: Quote for the top of references (just like a chapter quote if you're using them).  Comment to skip.
% \begin{savequote}[8cm]
% The first kind of intellectual and artistic personality belongs to the hedgehogs, the second to the foxes \dots
