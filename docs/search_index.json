This research has a focus on ratios of observed events to expected events, and testing hypothesis about hot-spots 0.2 HIV/AIDS The HIV/AIDS epidemic has a large disease burden The disease burden is unevenly distributed in space and across communities Surveillance techniques and statistical models have been used to respond to the epidemic Aims for HIV response going forward, and surveillance capabilities are needed to meet them Data difficulties including sparsity in space and time, survey bias, conflicting information sources, hard to reach populations, demography Phasing out of nationally-representative household surveys for HIV. Importance of relying on multiple sources of information: evidence synthesis, Naomi, multivariate models. Bayesian survey design Why isn’t case-based surveillance included yet? There aren’t individual linked databases and patient records have to be consolidated Passive case-based surveillance Post-hoc matching and create a case-based surveillance record Key HIV indicators are HIV prevalence, HIV incidence, ART coverage and coverage of other interventions such as PrEP, PEP Drivers of transmission Possible interventions are ART, condoms, PrEP and PEP, education, economic empowerment, VMMC Geographic priorisation versus demographic priorisation: hotspots, key populations, screening and individual level risk characteristics Adolescent girls and young women identified as a key demographic, stratification by sexual risk Interventions more likely to be demographic specific rather than geographic specific so if majority of difference in effectiveness depends on intervention type then demographic targeting may be more priority The population strategy of Geoffrey Rose 0.3 Statistics Definition of a latent Gaussian model (Rue, Martino, and Chopin 2009) Common examples Examples of models used in HIV inference which are close to being latent Gaussian models, but aren’t, and hence can’t be fit using INLA Disaggregation models Evidence synthesis models like Naomi (Eaton et al. 2021, 2019) Compartmental models ART attendance models Multinomial models like for district-level risk factors Multinomial logistic regression Other complex models from ecology that can’t currently be fit using INLA Definition of extended latent Gaussian models (Stringer, Brown, and Stafford 2021) Many-to-one is not an issue for R-INLA, the latent field is implemented as a concatenation of many vectors already. For example, for \\(\\eta_i = \\beta_0 + \\phi_i\\) with \\(i = 1, \\ldots, n\\) the latent field is \\((\\eta_1, \\ldots, \\eta_n, \\beta_0, \\phi_1, \\ldots, \\phi_n)^\\top\\) of dimension \\(2n + 1\\) For additive models, the only non-linearity is in the link function Approximate Bayesian inference methods Markov chain Monte Carlo Variational Bayes Laplace approximation and integrated nested Laplace approximation Empirical Bayes Particular properties of spatio-temporal models (and LGMs) which make INLA, if feasible, often the best option The increasing popularity of empirical Bayes approaches, like Template Model Builder (Osgood-Zimmerman and Wakefield 2021) Adaptive Gauss Hermite quadrature (AGHQ), like the central composite design (CCD) and grid strategies, is one way to choose the hyper-parameter integration points in the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) Finn Lindgren is working on a method for non-linear predictors, called the iterative INLA method More slides here Thesis work of Follestad that stayed as a preprint How does the ecological fallacy relate to aggregated output models References "],["understanding-models-for-spatial-structure-in-small-area-estimation.html", "Understanding models for spatial structure in small-area estimation", " Understanding models for spatial structure in small-area estimation The repository for this work is athowes/areal-comparison.
