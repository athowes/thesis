Disease burden is unevenly distributed. Effective public health response and prioritised prevention requires accurate, timely, high-resolution estimates of epidemic and demographic indicators. Complex statistical models are required to overcome significant data challenges. In this thesis, I develop and apply Bayesian spatio-temporal methods for HIV surveillance. Welcome This is the e-book version of my PhD thesis, submitted to Imperial College London in accordance with the requirements of the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Modern Statistics and Statistical Machine Learning. The associated GitHub repository is athowes/thesis.

This research has a focus on ratios of observed events to expected events, and testing hypothesis about hot-spots. 0.2 HIV/AIDS HIV/AIDS has a large disease burden The disease burden is unevenly distributed in space and across communities and individuals Surveillance techniques and statistical models have been used to respond to the epidemic Key HIV indicators are HIV prevalence, HIV incidence, ART coverage and coverage of other interventions such as PrEP, PEP Data difficulties including sparsity in space and time, survey bias, conflicting information sources, hard to reach populations, demography Aims for HIV response going forward, and surveillance capabilities are needed to meet them Phasing out of nationally-representative household surveys for HIV Bayesian survey design Importance of relying on multiple sources of information Creates requirement for for complex models e.g. evidence synthesis, Naomi, multivariate models Why isn’t case-based surveillance included yet? There aren’t individual linked databases and patient records have to be consolidated Passive case-based surveillance Post-hoc matching and create a case-based surveillance record Drivers of transmission Possible interventions are ART, condoms, PrEP and PEP, education, economic empowerment, VMMC Geographic priorisation versus demographic priorisation: hotspots, key populations, screening and individual level risk characteristics Adolescent girls and young women identified as a key demographic, stratification by sexual risk Interventions more likely to be demographic specific rather than geographic specific so if majority of difference in effectiveness depends on intervention type then demographic targeting may be more priority The population strategy of Geoffrey Rose 0.3 Bayesian spatio-temporal statistics The practice of doing Bayesian statistics primarily concerns construction of a generative model for the data we observe In spatio-temporal statistics, the data is indexed by spatial and or temporal location The independent and identically distributed (IID) assumptions commonly used for observations are rarely suitable in the spatio-temporal setting We expect there to be spatio-temporal structure Given a generative model, computation of the posterior distribution proceeds using approximate Bayesian inference methods Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is the most popular approach and works by simulating samples from a Markov chain which by construction has stationary distribution equal to the distribution of interest Variational Bayes approaches assume the posterior distribution belongs to some class and use optimisation to choose the best member of that class Laplace approximation and integrated nested Laplace approximation Empirical Bayes Definition of a latent Gaussian model (Rue, Martino, and Chopin 2009) \\[\\begin{alignat}{2} &amp;\\text{(Observations)} &amp; y_i &amp;\\sim p(y_i \\, | \\, x_i, \\btheta), \\quad i = 1, \\ldots, n, \\label{eq:data} \\\\ &amp;\\text{(Latent field)} &amp; \\x &amp;\\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\x \\, | \\, \\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{Q}(\\btheta)^{-1}), \\label{eq:process} \\\\ &amp;\\text{(Parameters)} &amp; \\qquad \\btheta &amp;\\sim p(\\btheta), \\label{eq:parameters} \\end{alignat}\\] Common examples Examples of models used in HIV inference which are close to being latent Gaussian models, but aren’t, and hence can’t be fit using INLA Disaggregation models Evidence synthesis models like Naomi (Eaton et al. 2021, 2019) Compartmental models ART attendance models Multinomial models like for district-level risk factors Multinomial logistic regression Other complex models from ecology that can’t currently be fit using INLA Definition of extended latent Gaussian models (Stringer, Brown, and Stafford 2021) Many-to-one is not an issue for R-INLA, the latent field is implemented as a concatenation of many vectors already. For example, for \\(\\eta_i = \\beta_0 + \\phi_i\\) with \\(i = 1, \\ldots, n\\) the latent field is \\((\\eta_1, \\ldots, \\eta_n, \\beta_0, \\phi_1, \\ldots, \\phi_n)^\\top\\) of dimension \\(2n + 1\\) For additive models, the only non-linearity is in the link function Particular properties of spatio-temporal models (and LGMs) which make INLA, if feasible, often the best option The increasing popularity of empirical Bayes approaches, like Template Model Builder (Osgood-Zimmerman and Wakefield 2021) Adaptive Gauss Hermite quadrature (AGHQ), like the central composite design (CCD) and grid strategies, is one way to choose the hyper-parameter integration points in the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) Finn Lindgren is working on a method for non-linear predictors, called the iterative INLA method More slides here Thesis work of Follestad that stayed as a preprint How does the ecological fallacy relate to aggregated output models References "],["understanding-models-for-spatial-structure-in-small-area-estimation.html", "Understanding models for spatial structure in small-area estimation", " Understanding models for spatial structure in small-area estimation The repository for this work is athowes/areal-comparison.
