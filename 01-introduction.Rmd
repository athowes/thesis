This thesis is about applied and methodological Bayesian statistics.
The focus is on questions motivated by surveillance of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa.
The data are related to people, located in space and time.
Tackling substantive applied questions has been a productive strategy for the statistical science discipline. 
As such, it is my hope that the work contained within will also be of interest more broadly.

## Chapter overview

* Chapter \@ref(background): I review the required background for the rest of the thesis.
* Chapter \@ref(beyond-borders): I raise concerns with the prevailing model for spatial structure used in small-area estimation, and evaluate whether these concerns have practical consequences [@howes2023beyond].
* Chapter \@ref(multi-agyw): I estimate the size of HIV risk groups for adolescent girls and young women across 13 countries in sub-Saharan Africa [@howes2023spatio].
* Chapter \@ref(naomi-aghq): I develop an approximate Bayesian inference method combining adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature with principal components analysis, and apply it to the Naomi small-area estimation model in Malawi [@howes2023fast].
* Chapter \@ref(conclusions): I discuss avenues for future work, and my conclusions regarding the PhD research.
