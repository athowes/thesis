This thesis is about applied and methodological Bayesian statistics.
It is Bayesian in the sense that I use probability models to draw conclusions from data.
It is applied and methodological in the sense that I am concerned with real world questions and the means to answer them.

The real world questions relate to surveillance of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa.
Though important progress has been made, over forty years since the first reported cases millions of people remain impacted by HIV each year.
Quantifying the epidemic using statistics is an important part of the public health response, and the path towards disease control and elimination. 

The data in this thesis are related to people.
Usually, people answering survey questions or using healthcare facilities.
Because the data have positions in space and time, statisticians describe it as spatio-temporal [@cressie2015statistics].
While there is a great diversity of spatio-temporal data, there are important and distinctive commonalities which make their shared study worthwhile.

Computation is an essential part of modern statistical practice.
Each project chapter is accompanied by computer code, hosted on GitHub.

## Chapter overview

* Chapter \@ref(background): I start by reviewing the required background for the rest of the thesis. This background concerns the HIV/AIDS epidemic and Bayesian spatio-temporal statistics.
* Chapter \@ref(beyond-borders): The prevailing model for spatial structure used in small-area estimation [@besag1991bayesian] was designed for analysis of a grid of pixels. The districts of a country are not a grid. I evaluate the practical consequences of this this concern [@howes2023beyond].
* Chapter \@ref(multi-agyw): Adolescent girls and young women are a demographic group at disproportionate risk of HIV infection. The Global AIDS Strategy suggests prioritising interventions on the basis of behaviour to prevent the most new infections. I estimate the size of behavioural risk groups across priority countries to enable implementation of the strategy, and assess the potential benefits [@howes2023spatio].
* Chapter \@ref(naomi-aghq): The Naomi small-area estimation model [@eaton2021naomi] is used across countries to estimate HIV indicators. I develop an approximate Bayesian inference method, designed with Naomi in mind, which combines adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature with principal components analysis, and apply it to data in Malawi [@howes2023fast].
* Chapter \@ref(conclusions): I discuss avenues for future work, and my conclusions regarding the research.
