## Additional figures

(ref:aaa-variance-proportions) The proportion of posterior variance explained by each random effect, calculated as a ratio of the random effect variance posterior mean to the sum of all random effect variance posterior means. To allow calculation of this metric by country, the model was run for each country individually.

```{r aaa-variance-proportions, fig.cap="(ref:aaa-variance-proportions)"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0("resources/multi-agyw/", resource_version, "/depends/aaa-variance-proportions.png"))
```

(ref:age-variation) For the 20-24 and 25-29 age groups, the proportion of AGYW in the one cohabiting partner and non-regular or multiple partner(s) risk groups was bimodal.

```{r age-variation, fig.cap="(ref:age-variation)"}
