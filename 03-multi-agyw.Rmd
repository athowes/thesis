# A multinomial spatio-temporal model for risk group proportions

In this chapter I describe an application of Bayesian spatio-temporal statistics to small-area estimation of HIV risk group proportions.
This project was initially worked on by Kathryn Risher, who continues to lead dissemination of the results as a tool to be used by countries, as well as model development and data extensions, and is described in @howes2022spatio, which I draw from here.
Code for the analysis in this chapter is available from [`athowes/multi-agyw`](https://github.com/athowes/multi-agyw).
