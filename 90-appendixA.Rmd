(ref:time-taken) A comparison of time taken to fit AGHQ via `aghq` as compared with NUTS via `tmbstan` for each inferential model. For the models run using NUTS via `tmbstan` there was significant variation in time taken depending on initial random seed. As such, these timings and more broadly the inferences obtained from NUTS in Appendix \@(aghq-nuts) should be interpreted with appropriate skepticism.

### BYM2 proportion

(ref:proportion-posteriors) The BYM2 proportion hyperparameter prior and posterior distributions for each of the four considered PHIA surveys (Table \@ref(tab:hiv-surveys)).
