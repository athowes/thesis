# Spatial structure {#beyond-borders}

<!-- For PDF output, include these two LaTeX commands after unnumbered chapter headings, otherwise the mini table of contents and the running header will show the previous chapter -->

In this chapter, I describe an investigation of spatial random effects specifications.
The motivated for this investigation was one of the fundamental questions encountered by an analyst during model construction.
Namely, should the model be augmented to better capture a feature of the data generating process that we believe exists?
The results are presented in @howes2023beyond.

Code for the analysis in this chapter is available from [`athowes/beyond-borders`](https://github.com/athowes/beyond-borders) and supported by the R package [`arealutils`](https://athowes.github.io/arealutils).
