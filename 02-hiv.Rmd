<!-- For PDF output, include these two LaTeX commands after unnumbered chapter headings, otherwise the mini table of contents and the running header will show the previous chapter -->

* Brief summary of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, up to the situation now, focusing on SSA
* The historic role of surveillance techniques and statistical models in responding to the epidemic
* The aims for HIV response going forward, and what surveillance capabilities are needed to meet them
* Data difficulties
  * Sparsity in space and time
  * Survey bias
  * Conflicting information sources
  * Hard to reach populations
  * Demography, knowing the correct denominator
* Phasing out of nationally-representative household surveys for HIV
  * Importance of relying on multiple sources of information: evidence synthesis, Naomi, multivariate models
  * Bayesian survey design
* Key HIV indicators
  * HIV prevalence
  * HIV incidence
  * ART coverage
  * Coverage of other interventions such as PrEP, PEP
* Drivers of transmission
* Possible interventions
  * ART
  * Condoms
  * PrEP and PEP
  * Education
  * Economic empowerment
  * VMMC
* Geographic targeting versus demographic targeting
  * Hotspots
  * Key populations
  * Screening and individual level risk characteristics
* Adolecent girls and young women identified as a key demographic
  * Stratification by sexual risk
* Interventions more likely to be demographic specific rather than geographic specific
  * If majority of difference in effectiveness depends on intervention type then demographic targeting may be more priority
* Small-area estimation in health, epidemiology and environment
  * The Small-Area Health Statistics Unit at Imperial was set-up to monitor health around point sources of environmental pollution in response to the Sellafield enquiry into the increased incidence of childhood leukemia leukaemia near a nuclear reprocessing plant [@elliott1992small]. This research has a focus on ratios of observed events to expected events, and testing hypothesis about hot-spots

## 19th October meeting

* Calculate empirical averages of categories (as for what to expect for category random effects)
* Fit a single survey model for all categories
* There are five countires where there exists good FSW data, fit the model there
* Important to talk about what is going on with non-regular partners in South Africa
* We will have more FSW data in future
* Look to submit to e.g. Lancet Child & Adolescent Health or PLoS Global Health
* Future work extending Laga et al. to use country elicited random error inflation, CFSW data, generalisation from countries with good survey data, in TMB or `aghq`
* Results shouldn't change when the constraints change
* Review posterior predictive estimates used for coverage
* Look at including PHIA or MICS
* Write a more extended version of the DHS survey questions
* Take posterior of 3rd category and use some post-hoc procedure to get the 4th category
