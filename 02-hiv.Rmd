* Brief summary of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, up to the situation now, focusing on SSA
* The historic role of surveillance techniques and statistical models in responding to the epidemic
* The aims for HIV response going forward, and what surveillance capabilities are needed to meet them
* Data difficulties
  * Sparsity in space and time
  * Survey bias
  * Conflicting information sources
  * Hard to reach populations
  * Demography, knowing the correct denominator
* Key HIV indicators
  * HIV prevalence
  * HIV incidence
  * ART coverage
* Drivers of transmission
* Possible interventions
* Geographic targeting versus demographic targeting
  * Hotspots
  * Key populations
  * Screening and individual level risk characteristics
* Adolecent girls and young women identified as a key demographic
  * Stratification by sexual risk
* Interventions more likely to be demographic specific rather than geographic specific
  * If majority of difference in effectiveness depends on intervention type then demographic targeting may be more priority
* Small-area estimation in health, epidemiology and environment
  * The Small-Area Health Statistics Unit at Imperial was set-up to monitor health around point sources of environmental pollution in response to the Sellafield enquiry into the increased incidence of childhood leukemia leukaemia near a nuclear reprocessing plant [@elliott1992small]. This research has a focus on ratios of observed events to expected events, and testing hypothesis about hot-spots
