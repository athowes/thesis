## Background {#background}

<!-- What is HIV -->
HIV is a retrovirus which infects humans.
If untreated, HIV develop into a more advanced stage known as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
HIV primarily attacks a type of white blood cell vital for the function of the immune system.
As a result, AIDS is characterised by increased risk of developing opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis or *Pneumocystis* pneumonias.

<!-- HIV is a big problem, plus how is it transmitted -->
The first AIDS cases were reported in Los Angeles in the early 1980s [@gottlieb1981pneumocystis; @barre1983isolation].
Since then, HIV has spread globally.
Transmission occurs by exposure to specific bodily fluids of an infected person.
The most common mode of transmission is via unprotected anal or vaginal sex, though transmission can also occur from a mother to her baby, or when drug injection equipment is shared.
Approximately `r custom_numbers_to_words(infections)` people have become infected with HIV, and of those `r custom_numbers_to_words(deaths)` have died of AIDS-related causes.

```

<!-- A lot of effort going into it -->
An ongoing global and multifaceted effort has been made to respond to the epidemic.
Groups that have played pivotal roles in shaping the response include local communities, civil society organisations, governments, research institutions, pharmaceutical companies, international agencies like the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), and global health initiatives such like the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (GFATM).
The investment of $`r custom_numbers_to_words(pepfar)` by PEPFAR constituting the "largest commitment by a single nation to address a single disease in history" indicates the scale of the response [@pepfar2022].

(ref:overall-picture) Globally, yearly new HIV infections peaked in 1995, and have since decreased by 59% and yearly AIDS-related deaths peaked in 2004, and have since decreased by 68% [@unaids2023aidsinfo].
Much of the disease burden is concentrated in eastern and southern Africa, as well as western and central Africa.

```

<!-- The effort has translated into progress -->
A substantial impact has been made on the course of the epidemic.
The number of new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths per year have both fallen significantly since their peak (Figure \@ref(fig:overall-picture)).
This progress comes due to implementation HIV prevention and treatment options.
I descibe the most significant of these below.

* Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a drug which stops the virus from replicating in the body.
A person living with HIV who takes ART daily can live a full and healthy life.
Of the `r custom_numbers_to_words(plhiv2022)` people living with HIV (PLHIV) in 2022, around `r coverage2022`% were accessing ART.
A staggering `r custom_numbers_to_words(art_deaths_averted)` AIDS-related deaths are estimated to have been averted by ART [@unaids2023global].
ART reduces the amount of virus in the blood and genital secretions.
If the virus is undetectable then there is considerable evidence that it cannot be transmitted sexually [@cohen2011prevention].
For this reason, as well as providing life saving treatment, ART also operates as prevention (TaSP).
Particular efforts have been made to provide pregnant women with ART, which is estimated to reduce the chance of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) by 25-35% in some settings [@siegfried2011antiretrovirals].
* Condoms are an inexpensive and effective method for prevention of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as *Chlamydia trachomatis*, *Neisseria gonorroeae*, syphilis, and *Trichomonas vaginalis*.
There has been a significant scale-up of condom usage since 1990, which is estimated to have averted `r custom_numbers_to_words(condom_infections_averted)` new HIV infections [@stover2021impact].
That said, there remain significant and difficult to close gaps in the proportion of individuals reporting they used a condom during their last high-risk sexual encounter.
* Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) has been found to provide partial protection against female-to-male HIV transmission.
Three landmark randomised control trials [@auvert2005randomized; @gray2007male; @bailey2007male] found complete surgical removal of the foreskin to result in a 50-60% reduction of HIV incidence in men.
Based on this evidence, VMMC has been recommended since 2007 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNAIDS as a key HIV intervention in high-prevalence settings.
Scale up of VMMC across 15 priority countries between 2008 and 2019 is estimated to have already averted `r custom_numbers_to_words(vmmc_infections_averted)` new HIV infections, though the future number of new HIV infections averted is likely to be much higher.
* Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) are drugs which can be taken before and after exposure to prevent transmission.
More costly than some other prevention options, they are primarily useful in high risk settings.

Though progress had been made, there remains much more to do.
In 2022 there were `r custom_numbers_to_words(infections2022)` people newly infected with HIV and `r custom_numbers_to_words(deaths2022)` AIDS-related deaths, more than one every minute [@unaids2022global].
Bold fast-track targets have been set to accelerate the end of AIDS as global public health threat by 2030.
Meeting these targets in the context of disruption to HIV services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and a shortfall in HIV funding [@economist2023triple] requires renewed commitment.

(ref:naomi-continent) Adult (15-49) HIV prevalence varies substantially both within and between countries in SSA. These estimates from 2023 were generated by country teams using the Naomi small-area estimation model in a process supported by UNAIDS and are available from @unaids2023aidsinfo. White filled points are country-level estimates, and coloured points are district-level estimates. Results from Nigeria are yet to be approved and have been redacted. The estimates process in the Cabo Delgado province of Mozambique was disrupted by conflict. Obtaining results for the Democratic Republic of the Congo required removing some districts from the model. Country names are given by three-leter codes as published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

```

<!-- Prioritisation of interventions  -->
For available resources to have the greatest impact, it is important that HIV interventions are prioritised.
Under the precision public health paradigm, the right interventions should be provided to the right populations, in the right place, at the right time [@khoury2016precision].
Some interventions might be orders of magnitude more impactful than others [@ord2013moral].

<!-- Uneven burden in space -->
Disease burden varies substantially across multiple spatial scales.
In some countries, the epidemic is concentrated within small populations, and HIV prevalence is low.
In others, transmission is sustained in the general population, and HIV prevalence is higher.
Most of the countries severely affected by HIV are in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
It is estimated that `r round(ssa_plhiv2022 / plhiv2022 * 100)`% of the `r custom_numbers_to_words(plhiv2022)` PLHIV worldwide live in SSA.
Adult HIV prevalence (ages 15-49) is higher than 10% (Figure \@ref(fig:naomi-continent)) in some countries in southern Africa.
Just as there is variation between countries, there is variation within countries.
For example, adult HIV prevalence at the district municipality level in South Africa ranges from `r 6`% in Namakwa to `r 30`% in uMkhanyakude.

<!-- Uneven burden across people -->
In all countries and contexts, some groups of people are at much higher risk than others.
Groups of people at increased risk of HIV infection are known as key populations (KPs).
Examples include men who have sex with men (MSM), female sex workers (FSW), people who inject drugs (PWID), and transgender people (TGP) [@stevens2022key].
KPs are often marginalised, and face legal and social issues.
In concentrated settings, the majority of new HIV infections occur in KPs and their sexual partners.
In generalised settings like SSA, risk is more diffuse across the population.
For example, in SSA adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) are a large demographic group at increased risk of HIV infection [@risher2021age; @monod2023growing], but typically not considered a KP.

<!-- Practical methods for prevention prioritisation: geographic, demographic, key population services, risk screening, individual-level risk characteristics. -->

## HIV surveillance {#surveillance}

<!-- What is surveillance and how can it be used to meet these needs -->
HIV surveillance refers to the collection, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of data relating to HIV/AIDS.
Surveillance can used to track epidemic indicators, identify at-risk populations, find drivers of transmission, and evaluate the impact of prevention and treatment programs.
Important indicators include:

* **HIV prevalence** is the proportion $\rho \in [0, 1]$ of the population who have HIV, typically written as a percentage.
Both new infections and more PLHIV remaining alive by taking treatment result in an increase in HIV prevalence.
As such, HIV prevalence should not be interpreted in isolation, and is primarily used indirectly to calculate other indicators, rather than directly in policy.
In some circumstances, when other indicators are difficult to estimate, HIV prevalence can be a useful proxy.
The number of PLHIV is given by $N\rho$, where $N$ is the population size.
* **HIV incidence** is the rate $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ of new HIV infections, typically written as number of new infections per 1000 person years.
HIV incidence can be specified in terms of HIV prevalence by $\lambda = N\Delta\rho$, where $\Delta\rho$ is the change in HIV prevalence over some time period.
Planning, delivery, and evaluation of prevention programming relies on estimates of HIV incidence.
* **ART coverage** is the proportion $\alpha \in [0, 1]$ of PLHIV who are on ART, typically written as a percentage.
Estimates of ART coverage play a direct role in the provision and target setting for treatment services.

<!-- Key data sources used to inform these indicators are: household surveys, programmatic data -->

### Challenges

Obtaining reliable, timely, estimates of these indicators at an appropriate spatial resolution is challenging.
Among the most significant difficulties are:

1. **Data sparsity**
Collection of data is costly and time consuming.
As a result, limited direct data might be available for the particular time, location, and sub-population of interest.
For example, in many countries the last household survey conducted is several years out of date.
4. **Missing data**
The sampling frame may not correspond to the target population.
For example, many KPs are difficult to reach, and may be ommited from sampling frames.
Individuals included on the sampling frame may choose not to respond.
All surveys are subject to sampling error, as only a subset of the target population are sampled.
Each of these issues can be characterised as being due to missing data.
I characterise data sparsity as referring to limited study availability, and missing data as referring to the shortfalls of any given study.
3. **Survey biases**
Individuals may be hesitant to disclose their HIV status, or report higher risk behaviours, due to social desirability bias and a fear of discrimination or stigma.
When available, biomarker data can be used to overcome under-reporting, but still may be subject to measurement errors.
4. **Denominators and demography**
Many indicators are rates or proportions, which rely on estimates of the population at risk in the denominator.
Accurately estimating population denominators is itself a challenging task [@tatem2017worldpop].
Taking a ratio of uncertain quantities amplifies uncertainty, but is rarely properly accounted for.
5. **Reliance on epidemiological parameters**
Indicators rely on estimates of epidemiological parameters obtained from cohort studies.
These parameters may not generalise to the setting of interest.
Further, they are typically applied coarsely, and without proper accounting for uncertainty.

### Statistical approaches

The challenges above make direct interpretation of the data often misleading.
Careful statistical modelling is required to overcome these limitations.

1. **Borrowing information**
When little direct data is available, data judged to be indirectly related can be used to help improve estimation.
For example, if limited data is available for men aged 30-34 is a particular country, it is likely reasonable to make use of the data for men aged 35-39.
As well as over age groups, information can be borrowed between and within countries, and across times. 
2. **Evidence synthesis**
Multiple sources of evidence can be combined to overcome the limitations of any one data source.
For example, infrequently run household surveys can be complimented by up to date programmatic data.
3. **Expert guidance**
Expert epidemiological, demographic, and local stakeholder guidance can be used to improve estimates.
Ensuring the quality of any data used in the estimation process is essential.

### Future directions

Aims for HIV response going forward, and the surveillance capabilities needed to meet them.

1. **Greater reliance on routine health system data** It is not recommended to include HIV testing in nationally representative household surveys in low (<2%) HIV prevalence settings [@world2005guidelines]. Patient-level HIV data systems [@world2017consolidated]. Case-based surveillance (CBS).
2. **Integration with other health programs** Strengthen health systems.
