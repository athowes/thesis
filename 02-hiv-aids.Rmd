## Background

<!-- What is HIV -->
HIV is a retrovirus which infects humans.
If untreated, HIV can develop into a more advanced stage known as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
HIV primarily attacks a type of white blood cell vital for the function of the immune system.
As a result, AIDS is characterised by increased risk of developing opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis or *Pneumocystis* pneumonias.

<!-- HIV is a big problem, plus how is it transmitted -->
The first AIDS cases were reported in Los Angeles in the early 1980s.
Since then, HIV has spread globally.
Transmission occurs by exposure to specific bodily fluids of an infected person.
The most common mode of transmission is via unprotected anal or vaginal sex, though transmission can also occur from a mother to her baby, or when drug injection equipment is shared.
Approximately `r custom_numbers_to_words(infections)` people have become infected with HIV, and of those `r custom_numbers_to_words(deaths)` have died of AIDS-related causes.

```{r}
pepfar <- 85 * 1e9
#' From https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/hivaids/
global_fund <- round((24.2 + 5)) * 1e9
```

<!-- A lot of effort going into it -->
A major international effort has been made to address the epidemic, including by national governments, civil society organisations, pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, international agencies such as the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), and global health initiatives such as the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR; \$`r custom_numbers_to_words(pepfar)` invested) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (GFATM; \$`r custom_numbers_to_words(global_fund)` invested).
A number of interventions have had a substantial impact on the course of the epidemic.
These include:

```{r}
#' From https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2021/september/20210906_global-roll-out-hiv-treatment
art_deaths_averted <- 16.5 * 1e6
condom_infections_averted <- 117 * 1e6
```

* Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a drug which stops the virus from replicating in the body.
By taking ART daily, a person living with HIV can live a full and healthy life.
Of the `r custom_numbers_to_words(plhiv2022)` people living with HIV (PLHIV) in 2022, around `r coverage2022`% were accessing ART.
As such, ART is estimated to have averted `r custom_numbers_to_words(art_deaths_averted)` AIDS-related deaths.
Further, if the virus is undetectable then it cannot be transmitted sexually [@cohen2011prevention].
For this reason, treatment also operates as prevention (TaSP).
ART has been estimated to have averted this many new infections.
* Condoms are an inexpensive and effective method for prevention of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as *Chlamydia trachomatis*, *Neisseria gonorroeae*, syphilis, and *Trichomonas vaginalis*.
There has been a significant scale-up of condom usage since 1990, which is estimated to have averted `r custom_numbers_to_words(condom_infections_averted)` new HIV infections [@stover2021impact].
However, there remain significant and difficult to close gaps in condom use at last high-risk sex.
* Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC), in which the foreskin is completely removed surgically, has been found to provide partial protection against female-to-male HIV transmission, resulting in a reduction of HIV incidence in men by 50-60% [@auvert2005randomized; @gray2007male; @bailey2007male].
* Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) are drugs which can be taken before and after exposure to prevent transmission.
They are primarily useful in high risk settings.

```{r overall-picture, fig.cap="Globally, yearly new HIV infections peaked in 1995, and have since decreased by 59\\% and yearly AIDS-related deaths peaked in 2004, and have since decreased by 68\\%. Much of the disease burden is concentrated in eastern and southern Africa, as well as western and central Africa. These two regions combined comprise sub-Saharan Africa."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/overall-picture.png")
```

The epidemic response has seen both the yearly number of new HIV cases and number of AIDS-related deaths fall significantly since their respective peaks (Figure \@ref(fig:overall-picture)).
However, there remains significant distance to go in ending AIDS as a public health threat: in 2022 there were `r custom_numbers_to_words(infections2022)` people newly infected with HIV and `r custom_numbers_to_words(deaths2022)` AIDS-related deaths [@unaids2022global].
Furthermore progress is halting due to lack of investment, COVID-19 and other reasons.

```{r naomi-continent, fig.cap="Adult (15-49) HIV prevalence varies substantially both within and between countries in SSA.

<!-- Uneven burden in space -->
There is substantial geographic variation in disease burden.
In some countries, the epidemic is concentrated within small populations, and prevalence is low.
In others, transmission is sustained in the general population, and prevalence is higher.
Most of the countries severely affected by HIV are in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), which accounts for `r round(ssa_plhiv2022 / plhiv2022 * 100)`% of PLHIV worldwide.
Adult HIV prevalence (ages 15-49) is as high as 10% or more in some countries in southern Africa.
As well as country-level geographic variation, there is significant variation between sub-national districts (Figure \@ref(fig:naomi-continent)).

<!-- Uneven burden across people -->
Across all settings, some people are at much higher risk than others.
Groups of people at increased risk of HIV infection are known as key populations (KPs), and include men who have sex with men (MSM), female sex workers (FSW), people who inject drugs (PWID), and transgender people (TGP).
KPs are often marginalised, and face legal and social issues.

<!-- How difuse is burden -->
Risk is more diffuse in SSA than in concentrated settings in which the majority of new infections occur among KPs.
For example, adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) are a demographic group at increased risk of HIV infection in SSA [@risher2021age; @monod2023growing].

<!-- Prioritisation of interventions  -->
For the available resources to have the greatest impact, it is important that HIV interventions are prioritised
The precision public health paradigm [@khoury2016precision] looks to provide the right intervention, to the right population, in the right place, at the right time.
<!-- Methods for prevention prioritisation include geographic, demographic, key population services, risk screening, and individual-level risk characteristics. -->

## HIV surveillance \label{sec:surveillance}

<!-- What is surveillance and how can it be used to meet these needs -->
HIV surveillance refers to the collection, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of data relating to HIV/AIDS.
Surveillance can used to track epidemic indicators, identify at-risk populations, find drivers of transmission, and evaluate the impact of prevention and treatment programs.

### HIV indicators

Central indicators include:

* **HIV prevalence** is the proportion $\rho \in [0, 1]$ of the population who have HIV, typically written as a percentage.
Interpreted alone, HIV prevalence can be misleading.
Prevalence increasing could be as a result of new infections, or as a result of more PLHIV remaining alive by taking treatment.
As such, HIV prevalence is primarily used in calculations of other indicators, rather than directly itself.
In some circumstances those other indicators can be difficult to estimate, and HIV prevalence can be a useful proxy.
The number of PLHIV is given by $N\rho$, where $N$ is the population size.
* **HIV incidence** is the rate $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ of new HIV infections, typically written as number of new infections per 1000 person years.
HIV incidence can be specified in terms of HIV prevalence by $\lambda = N\Delta\rho$, where $\Delta\rho$ is the change in HIV prevalence over some time period.
Planning, delivery, and evaluation of prevention programming relies on estimates of HIV incidence.
* **ART coverage** is the proportion $\alpha \in [0, 1]$ of PLHIV who are on ART, typically written as a percentage.
Estimates of ART coverage play a direct role in the provision of treatment services.

### Challenges

There are significant difficulties associated with obtaining reliable, timely, estimates of these indicators at an appropriate resolution.

1. **Data sparsity**
Collection of data is costly and time consuming.
As a result, limited direct data might be available for the particular time, location, and sub-population of interest.
2. **Response biases**
Under-reporting.
Non-response.
Measurement error.
3. **Hard to reach populations**
Many of those at greatest risk, including KPs, are difficult to reach.
May not appear on household survey sampling frames.
4. **Denominators and demography**
Many indicators are rates or proportions, incorporating the population at risk in the denominator.
However, accurately estimating these denominators is usually itself a challenging task, and taking a ratio of uncertain quantities only goes to amplify the uncertainty.
For example, ART coverage has PLHIV as the denominator, which itself has the population size as its denominator.

### Statistical methods

The above challenges make direct interpretation of data misleading, and foreground the importance of careful statistical modelling.

1. **Borrowing information**
Although survey responses from women aged 20-24 are not directly informative about HIV prevalence in women 25-29, they are indirectly informative.
2. **Evidence synthesis**
Multiple sources of evidence can be combined to overcome limitations of any one data source.
3. **Expert guidance**
Expert epidemiological, demographic opinion can be used to improve estimates.

### Future trends

Aims for HIV response going forward, and surveillance capabilities are needed to meet them.

1. **Greater reliance on routine health system data** Phasing out of nationally representative household surveys.
2. **Integration with other health programs**
3. **Use of mobile technologies**
