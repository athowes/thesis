## Background

<!-- What is HIV -->
HIV is a retrovirus which infects humans.
If untreated, HIV can develop into a more advanced stage known as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
HIV primarily attacks a type of white blood cell vital for the function of the immune system.
As a result, AIDS is characterised by increased risk of developing opportunistic infections such as *Pneumocystis* pneumonia and tuberculosis.

<!-- HIV is a big problem, plus how is it transmitted -->
The first AIDS cases were reported in Los Angeles in the early 1980s.
Since then, HIV has spread globally.
Transmission occurs by exposure to specific bodily fluids of an infected person.
The most common mode of transmission is via unprotected anal or vaginal sex, though transmission can also occur from a mother to her baby, or when drug injection equipment is shared.
Approximately `r custom_numbers_to_words(infections)` people have become infected with HIV, and of those `r custom_numbers_to_words(deaths)` have died of AIDS-related causes.

```{r}
pepfar <- 85 * 1e9
#' From https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/hivaids/
global_fund <- (24.2 + 5) * 1e9
```

<!-- A lot of effort going into it -->
A major international effort has been made to address the epidemic, including by national governments, civil society organisations, pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, international agencies such as the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), and global health initiatives such as the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR; \$`r custom_numbers_to_words(pepfar)` invested) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (GFATM; \$`r custom_numbers_to_words(global_fund)` invested).
A number of interventions have had a substantial impact on the course of the epidemic:

* Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a drug which stops the virus from replicating in the body.
By taking ART daily, a person living with HIV can live a full and healthy life.
Of the `r custom_numbers_to_words(plhiv2022)` people living with HIV (PLHIV) in 2022, around `r coverage2022` are accessing ART.
As a result, ART is estimated to have averted `r custom_numbers_to_words(art_averted)` AIDS-related deaths.
Furthermore, if the virus is undetectable then it cannot be transmitted sexually.
For this reason, treatment also operates as prevention (TaSP).
ART has been estimated to have averted this many new infections.
* Condoms are an inexpensive and effective method for prevention of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
Scale-up of condom usage since 1990 has been estimated to have averted over `r custom_numbers_to_words(condom_averted_lb)` new HIV infections [@stover2021impact].
* Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) are drugs which can be taken before and after exposure to prevent transmission.
* Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) has been found to provide partial protection against female-to-male HIV transmission.

```{r overall-picture, fig.cap="Globally, yearly new HIV infections peaked in 1995, and have since decreased by 59\\% and yearly AIDS-related deaths peaked in 2004, and have since decreased by 68\\%. Data from UNAIDS epidemiological estimates 2023."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/overall-picture.png")
```

The epidemic response has seen both the yearly number of new HIV cases and number of AIDS-related deaths fall significantly since their respective peaks (Figure \ref{fig:overall-picture}).
However, there remains significant distance to go in ending AIDS as a public health threat: in 2022 there were `r custom_numbers_to_words(infections2022)` people newly infected with HIV and `r custom_numbers_to_words(deaths2022)` AIDS-related deaths [@unaids2022global].
Furthermore progress is halting due to lack of investment, COVID-19 and other reasons.

<!-- Uneven burden in space -->
There is substantial geographic inequality in disease burden.
In some countries, the epidemic is concentrated within small populations, and prevalence is low.
In others, transmission is sustained in the general population, and prevalence is higher.
Most of the countries severely affected by HIV are in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), which accounts for `r round(ssa_plhiv2022 / plhiv2022 * 100)`% of PLHIV worldwide.
Even within countries, there is significant geographic variation.

<!-- Uneven burden across people -->
Across all settings, the inequality in disease burden extends to groups.
Groups at increased risk of HIV infection are known as key populations (KPs), and include men who have sex with men (MSM), female sex workers (FSW), people who inject drugs (PWID), and transgender people (TGP).
KPs are often marginalised, and face legal and social issues.

<!-- How difuse is burden -->
In SSA, risk is more diffuse than in concentrated settings.
Demographic groups, while not classified as KPs, at increased risk of HIV infection include adolescent girls and young women (AGYW), migratory populations, and rural communities.

<!-- Prioritisation of interventions  -->
HIV interventions should be prioritised to have the greatest impact on the epidemic.
The precision public health paradigm aims to get the right interventions, to the right populations, in the right place, at the right time.
This requires data.
<!-- Methods for prevention prioritisation include geographic, demographic, key population services, risk screening, and individual-level risk characteristics. -->

## HIV surveillance \label{sec:surveillance}

<!-- What is surveillance and how can it be used to meet these needs -->
HIV surveillance refers to the collection, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of data relating to HIV/AIDS.
Surveillance can used to track epidemic indicators, identify at-risk populations, find drivers of transmission, and evaluate the impact of prevention and treatment programs.

### HIV indicators

Important indicators include:

* **HIV prevalence** The proportion of the population who have HIV $\rho$, typically given as a percentage.
Though an important indicator, HIV prevalence is for the most part used indirectly to calculate other indicators rather than directly itself.
In some circumstances those other indicators can be difficult to estimate, and HIV prevlance can be a useful proxy.
The number of PLHIV is given by $N\rho$, where $N$ is the population size.
* **HIV incidence** The rate of new HIV infections $\lambda$, typically given as number of new infections per 1000 person years.
HIV incidence can be specified in terms of HIV prevalence by $\lambda = N\Delta\rho$, where $\Delta\rho$ is the change in HIV prevalence over some time period.
* **ART coverage** The proportion of PLHIV who are on ART $\alpha$, typically given as a percentage.
Planning of treatment.

### Challenges

There are significant difficulties associated with obtaining reliable, timely, estimates of these indicators at an appropriate resolution.

1. **Data sparsity**
Collection of data is costly and time consuming.
As a result, limited direct data might be available for the particular time, location, and sub-population of interest.
2. **Response biases**
Under-reporting.
Non-response.
Measurement error.
3. **Hard to reach populations**
Many of those at greatest risk, including KPs, are difficult to reach.
May not appear on household survey sampling frames.
4. **Denominators and demography**
Many indicators are rates or proportions, incorporating the population at risk in the denominator.
However, accurately estimating these denominators is usually itself a challenging task, and taking a ratio of uncertain quantities only goes to amplify the uncertainty.
For example, ART coverage has PLHIV as the denominator, which itself has the population size as its denominator.

### Statistical methods

The above challenges make direct interpretation of data misleading, and foreground the importance of careful statistical modelling.

1. **Borrowing information**
Although survey responses from women aged 20-24 are not directly informative about HIV prevalence in women 25-29, they are indirectly informative.
2. **Evidence synthesis**
Multiple sources of evidence can be combined to overcome limitations of any one data source.
3. **Expert guidance**
Expert epidemiological, demographic opinion can be used to improve estimates.

### Future trends

Aims for HIV response going forward, and surveillance capabilities are needed to meet them.

1. **Greater reliance on routine health system data** Phasing out of nationally representative household surveys.
2. **Integration with other health programs**
3. **Use of mobile technologies**
