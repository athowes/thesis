## Background

<!-- What is HIV -->
HIV is a retrovirus which infects humans.
If untreated, HIV can develop into a more advanced stage known as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
HIV primarily attacks a type of white blood cell vital for the function of the immune system.
As a result, AIDS is characterised by increased risk of developing opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis or *Pneumocystis* pneumonias.

<!-- HIV is a big problem, plus how is it transmitted -->
The first AIDS cases were reported in Los Angeles in the early 1980s.
Since then, HIV has spread globally.
Transmission occurs by exposure to specific bodily fluids of an infected person.
The most common mode of transmission is via unprotected anal or vaginal sex, though transmission can also occur from a mother to her baby, or when drug injection equipment is shared.
Approximately `r custom_numbers_to_words(infections)` people have become infected with HIV, and of those `r custom_numbers_to_words(deaths)` have died of AIDS-related causes.

```

<!-- A lot of effort going into it -->
A global and multifaceted effort has been made to respond to the epidemic.
Many groups have played pivotal roles in shaping the response, including local communities, civil society organisations, governments, research institutions, pharmaceutical companies, international agencies like the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), and global health initiatives such like the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (GFATM).
Over $`r custom_numbers_to_words(pepfar)` has been invested by PEPFAR alone, constituting the "largest commitment by a single nation to address a single disease in history" [@pepfar2022].

```

<!-- The effort has translated into progress -->
This combined effort has made a substantial impact on the course of the epidemic.
Since their peak, the number of new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths per year have both fallen significantly (Figure \@ref(fig:overall-picture)).
This success has been due to a number of HIV prevention and treatment options.

* Perhaps the most important HIV intervention, antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a drug which stops the virus from replicating in the body.
A person living with HIV who takes ART daily can live a full and healthy life.
Of the `r custom_numbers_to_words(plhiv2022)` people living with HIV (PLHIV) in 2022, around `r coverage2022`% were accessing ART.
A staggering `r custom_numbers_to_words(art_deaths_averted)` AIDS-related deaths are estimated to have been averted by ART.
ART reduces the amount of virus in the blood and genital secretions.
If the virus is undetectable then there is considerable evidence that it cannot be transmitted sexually [@cohen2011prevention].
For this reason, as well as providing life saving treatment, ART also operates as prevention (TaSP).
Particular efforts have been made to provide pregnant women with ART, which is estimated to reduce the chance of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) by 25-35% in some settings [@siegfried2011antiretrovirals].
* Condoms are an inexpensive and effective method for prevention of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as *Chlamydia trachomatis*, *Neisseria gonorroeae*, syphilis, and *Trichomonas vaginalis*.
There has been a significant scale-up of condom usage since 1990, which is estimated to have averted `r custom_numbers_to_words(condom_infections_averted)` new HIV infections [@stover2021impact].
Even so, there remain significant and difficult to close gaps in the proportion of individuals reporting they used a condom during their last high-risk sexual encounter.
* Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) has been found to provide partial protection against female-to-male HIV transmission.
Three landmark randomised control trials [@auvert2005randomized; @gray2007male; @bailey2007male] found complete surgical removal of the foreskin to result in a 50-60% reduction of HIV incidence in men.
Based on this evidence, VMMC has been recommended by WHO and UNAIDS as a key HIV intervention in high-prevalence settings since 2007.
Scale up of VMMC across 15 priority countries between 2008 and 2019 was estimated to have already averted `r custom_numbers_to_words(vmmc_infections_averted)` new HIV infections, though the future number of new HIV infections averted is likely to be much higher.
* Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) are drugs which can be taken before and after exposure to prevent transmission.
They are primarily useful in high risk settings.

It is important that progress is sustained.
There remains some distance to go in ending AIDS as a public health threat.
In 2022 there were `r custom_numbers_to_words(infections2022)` people newly infected with HIV and `r custom_numbers_to_words(deaths2022)` AIDS-related deaths [@unaids2022global].

```{r naomi-continent, fig.cap="Adult (15-49) HIV prevalence varies substantially both within and between countries in SSA.

<!-- Uneven burden in space -->
Disease burden varies substantially across multiple spatial scales.
In some countries, the epidemic is concentrated within small populations, and HIV prevalence is low.
In others, transmission is sustained in the general population, and HIV prevalence is higher.
Most of the countries severely affected by HIV are in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
It is estimated that `r round(ssa_plhiv2022 / plhiv2022 * 100)`% of the `r custom_numbers_to_words(plhiv2022)` PLHIV worldwide live in SSA.
Adult HIV prevalence (ages 15-49) is higher than 10% (Figure \@ref(fig:naomi-continent)) in some countries in southern Africa.
Just as there is variation between countries, there is variation within countries.
For example, adult HIV prevalenceat the district municipality level in South Africa ranges from `r 6`% in Namakwa to `r 30`% in uMkhanyakude.

<!-- Uneven burden across people -->
In all countries, some groups of people are at much higher risk than others.
Groups of people at increased risk of HIV infection are known as key populations (KPs).
Examples include men who have sex with men (MSM), female sex workers (FSW), people who inject drugs (PWID), and transgender people (TGP).
KPs are often marginalised, and face legal and social issues.
In concentrated settings, the majority of new HIV infections occur among KPs.
In generalised settings like SSA, risk is more diffuse accross the population.
For example, adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) are a large demographic group at increased risk of HIV infection in SSA [@risher2021age; @monod2023growing].

<!-- Prioritisation of interventions  -->
For available resources to have the greatest impact, it is important that HIV interventions are prioritised [@ord2013moral].
The precision public health paradigm [@khoury2016precision] is an extension of precision medicine to public health, which looks to ensure the right interventions are provided to the right populations, in the right places, at the right times.
<!-- Methods for prevention prioritisation include geographic, demographic, key population services, risk screening, and individual-level risk characteristics. -->

## HIV surveillance \label{sec:surveillance}

<!-- What is surveillance and how can it be used to meet these needs -->
HIV surveillance refers to the collection, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of data relating to HIV/AIDS.
Surveillance can used to track epidemic indicators, identify at-risk populations, find drivers of transmission, and evaluate the impact of prevention and treatment programs.
Important indicators include:

* **HIV prevalence** is the proportion $\rho \in [0, 1]$ of the population who have HIV, typically written as a percentage.
Interpreted alone, HIV prevalence can be misleading.
HIV prevalence increasing could be as a result of new infections, or as a result of more PLHIV remaining alive by taking treatment.
As such, HIV prevalence is primarily used in calculations of other indicators, rather than directly itself.
In some circumstances those other indicators can be difficult to estimate, and HIV prevalence can be a useful proxy.
The number of PLHIV is given by $N\rho$, where $N$ is the population size.
* **HIV incidence** is the rate $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ of new HIV infections, typically written as number of new infections per 1000 person years.
HIV incidence can be specified in terms of HIV prevalence by $\lambda = N\Delta\rho$, where $\Delta\rho$ is the change in HIV prevalence over some time period.
Planning, delivery, and evaluation of prevention programming relies on estimates of HIV incidence.
* **ART coverage** is the proportion $\alpha \in [0, 1]$ of PLHIV who are on ART, typically written as a percentage.
Estimates of ART coverage play a direct role in the provision of treatment services.

There are significant difficulties associated with obtaining reliable, timely, estimates of these indicators at an appropriate resolution.
Among them:

1. **Data sparsity**
Collection of data is costly and time consuming.
As a result, limited direct data might be available for the particular time, location, and sub-population of interest.
2. **Survey biases**
Individuals may be hesitant to disclose their HIV status, or report higher risk behaviours, due to social desirability bias and a fear of discrimination or stigma.
When available, biomarker data can be used to overcome under-reporting, it may still be subject to measurement errors.
3. **Missing data**
Many of the populations at greatest risk are difficult to reach, and not appear on household survey sampling frames.
Individuals included on the sampling frame may choose not to respond.
4. **Denominators and demography**
Many indicators are rates or proportions, which incorporate the population at risk in the denominator.
Accurately estimating these denominators is usually itself a challenging task.
Taking a ratio of uncertain quantities only goes to amplify the uncertainty.
For example, ART coverage has PLHIV as the denominator, which itself has the population size as its denominator.

The above challenges make direct interpretation of the data misleading.
Careful statistical modelling is required to overcome these limitations.

1. **Borrowing information**
Data not directly about the indicator of interest, but judged to be indirectly related, can be used to help improve estimates when little direct data is available.
For example, if limited data is available for men aged 30-34, it may be reasonable to make use of the data for men aged 35-39.
2. **Evidence synthesis**
Multiple sources of evidence can be combined to overcome limitations of any one data source.
3. **Expert guidance**
Expert epidemiological, demographic opinion can be used to improve estimates.

Aims for HIV response going forward, and surveillance capabilities are needed to meet them.

1. **Greater reliance on routine health system data** Phasing out of nationally representative household surveys.
2. **Integration with other health programs**
3. **Use of mobile technologies**
