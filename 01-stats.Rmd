* Definition of a latent Gaussian model [@rue2009approximate]
  * Common examples
* Examples of models used in HIV inference which are close to being latent Gaussian models, but aren't, and hence can't be fit using INLA
  * Disaggregation models 
  * Naomi and evidence synthesis models [Cite Naomi paper]
  * Compartmental models
* Definition of extended latent Gaussian models [@stringer2021fast]
* Approximate Bayesian inference methods
  * Markov chain Monte Carlo
  * Variational Bayes
  * Laplace approximation and integrated nested Laplace approximation
  * Empirical Bayes
* Particular properties of spatio-temporal models (and LGMs) which make INLA, if feasible, often the best option
* The increasing popularity of empirical Bayes approaches, like Template Model Builder [@osgoodzimmerman2021statistical]
