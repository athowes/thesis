## Disease surveillance

* Small-area estimation in health, epidemiology and environment
  * The Small-Area Health Statistics Unit at Imperial was set-up to monitor health around point sources of environmental pollution in response to the Sellafield enquiry into the increased incidence of childhood leukemia leukaemia near a nuclear reprocessing plant [@elliott1992small]. This research has a focus on ratios of observed events to expected events, and testing hypothesis about hot-spots

## HIV/AIDS

* The HIV/AIDS epidemic has a large disease burden
* The disease burden is unevenly distributed in space and across communities
* Surveillance techniques and statistical models have been used to respond to the epidemic
* Aims for HIV response going forward, and surveillance capabilities are needed to meet them
* Data difficulties including sparsity in space and time, survey bias, conflicting information sources, hard to reach populations, demography
* Phasing out of nationally-representative household surveys for HIV. Importance of relying on multiple sources of information: evidence synthesis, Naomi, multivariate models. Bayesian survey design
* Why isn't case-based surveillance included yet?
  * There aren't individual linked databases and patient records have to be consolidated
  * Passive case-based surveillance
  * Post-hoc matching and create a case-based surveillance record
* Key HIV indicators are HIV prevalence, HIV incidence, ART coverage and coverage of other interventions such as PrEP, PEP
* Drivers of transmission
* Possible interventions are ART, condoms, PrEP and PEP, education, economic empowerment, VMMC
* Geographic priorisation versus demographic priorisation: hotspots, key populations, screening and individual level risk characteristics
* Adolescent girls and young women identified as a key demographic, stratification by sexual risk
* Interventions more likely to be demographic specific rather than geographic specific so if majority of difference in effectiveness depends on intervention type then demographic targeting may be more priority
* The population strategy of Geoffrey Rose 

## Statistics

* Definition of a latent Gaussian model [@rue2009approximate]
  * Common examples
* Examples of models used in HIV inference which are close to being latent Gaussian models, but aren't, and hence can't be fit using INLA
  * Disaggregation models
  * Evidence synthesis models like Naomi [@eaton2021naomi; @eaton2019joint]
  * Compartmental models
  * ART attendance models
  * Multinomial models like for district-level risk factors
    * Multinomial logistic regression
* Other complex models from [ecology](https://www.bioss.ac.uk/rsse/2013/September2013slides-Illian.pdf) that can't currently be fit using INLA
* Definition of extended latent Gaussian models [@stringer2021fast]
  * Many-to-one is not an issue for `R-INLA`, the latent field is implemented as a concatenation of many vectors already. For example, for $\eta_i = \beta_0 + \phi_i$ with $i = 1, \ldots, n$ the latent field is $(\eta_1, \ldots, \eta_n, \beta_0, \phi_1, \ldots, \phi_n)^\top$ of dimension $2n + 1$
  * For additive models, the only non-linearity is in the link function
* Approximate Bayesian inference methods
  * Markov chain Monte Carlo
  * Variational Bayes
  * Laplace approximation and integrated nested Laplace approximation
  * Empirical Bayes
* Particular properties of spatio-temporal models (and LGMs) which make INLA, if feasible, often the best option
* The increasing popularity of empirical Bayes approaches, like Template Model Builder [@osgoodzimmerman2021statistical]
* Adaptive Gauss Hermite quadrature (AGHQ), like the central composite design (CCD) and grid strategies, is one way to choose the hyper-parameter integration points in the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA)
* Finn Lindgren is working on a method for non-linear predictors, called the [iterative INLA method](https://github.com/inlabru-org/inlabru/blob/55896f10d563c14e34cab577b29b733aac051f86/vignettes/method.Rmd)
  * More [slides](https://informatique-mia.inrae.fr/reseau-resste/sites/default/files/2020-09/slides-Lindgren_Avignon2018.pdf) here
* Thesis work of [Follestad](https://cds.cern.ch/record/639625/files/sis-2003-305.pdf) that stayed as a preprint
* How does the ecological fallacy relate to aggregated output models
