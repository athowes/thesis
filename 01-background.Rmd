## Disease surveillance and small-area estimation

* Disease surveillance is a central application of statistics
* Small-area estimation in health, epidemiology and environment
* The Small-Area Health Statistics Unit at Imperial was set-up to monitor health around point sources of environmental pollution in response to the Sellafield enquiry into the increased incidence of childhood leukemia leukaemia near a nuclear reprocessing plant [@elliott1992small]. This research has a focus on ratios of observed events to expected events, and testing hypothesis about hot-spots.

## HIV/AIDS

* HIV/AIDS has a large disease burden
* The disease burden is unevenly distributed in space and across communities and individuals
* Surveillance techniques and statistical models have been used to respond to the epidemic
* Key HIV indicators are HIV prevalence, HIV incidence, ART coverage and coverage of other interventions such as PrEP, PEP
* Data difficulties including sparsity in space and time, survey bias, conflicting information sources, hard to reach populations, demography
* Aims for HIV response going forward, and surveillance capabilities are needed to meet them
* Phasing out of nationally-representative household surveys for HIV
  * Bayesian survey design
* Importance of relying on multiple sources of information
  Creates requirement for for complex models e.g. evidence synthesis, Naomi, multivariate models
* Why isn't case-based surveillance included yet?
  * There aren't individual linked databases and patient records have to be consolidated
  * Passive case-based surveillance
  * Post-hoc matching and create a case-based surveillance record
* Drivers of transmission
* Possible interventions are ART, condoms, PrEP and PEP, education, economic empowerment, VMMC
* Geographic priorisation versus demographic priorisation: hotspots, key populations, screening and individual level risk characteristics
* Adolescent girls and young women identified as a key demographic, stratification by sexual risk
* Interventions more likely to be demographic specific rather than geographic specific so if majority of difference in effectiveness depends on intervention type then demographic targeting may be more priority
* The population strategy of Geoffrey Rose 

## Bayesian spatio-temporal statistics

* The practice of doing Bayesian statistics primarily concerns construction of a generative model for the data we observe
* In spatio-temporal statistics, the data is indexed by spatial and or temporal location
* The independent and identically distributed (IID) assumptions commonly used for observations are rarely suitable in the spatio-temporal setting
* We expect there to be spatio-temporal structure
* Given a generative model, computation of the posterior distribution proceeds using approximate Bayesian inference methods
* Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is the most popular approach and works by simulating samples from a Markov chain which by construction has stationary distribution equal to the distribution of interest
* Variational Bayes approaches assume the posterior distribution belongs to some class and use optimisation to choose the best member of that class
* Laplace approximation and integrated nested Laplace approximation
* Empirical Bayes
* Definition of a latent Gaussian model [@rue2009approximate]
\begin{alignat}{2}
&\text{(Observations)}     &        y_i &\sim p(y_i \, | \, x_i, \btheta), \quad i = 1, \ldots, n, \label{eq:data} \\
&\text{(Latent field)}     &        \x &\sim \mathcal{N}(\x \, | \, \mathbf{0}, \mathbf{Q}(\btheta)^{-1}), \label{eq:process} \\
&\text{(Parameters)}       & \qquad \btheta &\sim p(\btheta), \label{eq:parameters}
\end{alignat}
  * Common examples
* Examples of models used in HIV inference which are close to being latent Gaussian models, but aren't, and hence can't be fit using INLA
  * Disaggregation models
  * Evidence synthesis models like Naomi [@eaton2021naomi; @eaton2019joint]
  * Compartmental models
  * ART attendance models
  * Multinomial models like for district-level risk factors
    * Multinomial logistic regression
* Other complex models from [ecology](https://www.bioss.ac.uk/rsse/2013/September2013slides-Illian.pdf) that can't currently be fit using INLA
* Definition of extended latent Gaussian models [@stringer2021fast]
  * Many-to-one is not an issue for `R-INLA`, the latent field is implemented as a concatenation of many vectors already. For example, for $\eta_i = \beta_0 + \phi_i$ with $i = 1, \ldots, n$ the latent field is $(\eta_1, \ldots, \eta_n, \beta_0, \phi_1, \ldots, \phi_n)^\top$ of dimension $2n + 1$
  * For additive models, the only non-linearity is in the link function
* Particular properties of spatio-temporal models (and LGMs) which make INLA, if feasible, often the best option
* The increasing popularity of empirical Bayes approaches, like Template Model Builder [@osgoodzimmerman2021statistical]
* Adaptive Gauss Hermite quadrature (AGHQ), like the central composite design (CCD) and grid strategies, is one way to choose the hyper-parameter integration points in the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA)
* Finn Lindgren is working on a method for non-linear predictors, called the [iterative INLA method](https://github.com/inlabru-org/inlabru/blob/55896f10d563c14e34cab577b29b733aac051f86/vignettes/method.Rmd)

* Thesis work of [Follestad](https://cds.cern.ch/record/639625/files/sis-2003-305.pdf) that stayed as a preprint
* How does the ecological fallacy relate to aggregated output models
