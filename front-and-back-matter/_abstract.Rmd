HIV is a large problem.
Disease burden is unevenly distributed.
Effective public health response and prioritised prevention requires accurate, timely, high-resolution estimates of epidemic and demographic indicators.
Complex statistical models are required to overcome significant data challenges.
In this thesis, I develop and apply Bayesian spatio-temporal methods for HIV surveillance.
