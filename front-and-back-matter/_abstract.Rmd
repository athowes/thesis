Progress towards ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030 is faltering.
Effective public health response requires accurate, timely, high-resolution estimates of epidemic and demographic indicators.
Limitations of available data make obtaining such estimates difficult.
I develop and apply Bayesian spatio-temporal methods to meet this challenge.
Firstly, I examine models for area-level spatial structure.
Secondly, I estimate district-level HIV risk group proportions, enabling behavioural prioritisation of prevention services, as put forward by the Global AIDS Strategy.
Finally, I develop a novel Bayesian inference method, combining adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature with principal component analysis, motivated by the Naomi district-level model of HIV indicators.
In sum, the contributions in this thesis help to guide precision HIV policy in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as advancing Bayesian methods for spatio-temporal data.
