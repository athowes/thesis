I would express my gratitude to Seth Flaxman and Jeff Eaton for their mentorship throughout my time as a graduate student.
Their guidance has been crucial in shaping the direction of this thesis, and my development as a scientist.
<!-- Thanks to my examiners Adam Sykulski and Chris Paciorek. -->
I am grateful to the HIV Inference Group at Imperial for exposing me to research focused on providing actionable evidence, helping me learn to present my research, and tolerating a mathematician.
Research environment provided by the Modern Statistics and Statistical Machine Learning Centre for Doctoral Training at Imperial and Oxford and the Machine Learning and Global Health Network.
This research was made possible by funding provided by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and EPSRC.

Thank you to Mike McLaren, Kevin Esvelt, the Nucleic Acid Observatory team, and the Sculpting Evolution lab for hosting my visit to the MIT Media Lab.
Thanks also to the friends I met in Cambridge: Lenni, Lenny, Janika, Geetha, Simon, Frances, Leilani and Tammy.
I returned from Cambridge stand-up meeting, Google document, and raised aspirations in hand.

Thank you to Alex Stringer, and the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, for hosting my visit to the University of Waterloo.
Without Alex, Chapter \@ref(naomi-aghq) wouldn't have gotten anywhere, and I'd still be waiting for MCMC to converge in Chapter \@ref(beyond-borders).
Thanks to Tim Lucas and Patrick Brown for connecting us.
Thanks also to my tour guide in Waterloo, Kate.
I would also like to express my thanks to Håvard Rue and Finn Lindgren for their helpful answers on the `R-INLA` discussion group.

My sense for what matters has been shaped, and arguably improved, by the Effective Altruism community.
Thank you to the Meridian, Trajan, and LEAH offices for hosting me this final year.
Thank you to my housemates August, Dewi, Henry, Jerome, Johnny, and Tamara: not to be all Bay area, but I'm proud of the intentional community we've built.
Pınar believed in me and my research at times when I didn't.
No thanks to Simon Marshall, he didn't help, if anything he held me back.
I extend my deepest thanks to my parents, Deborah and Karl, and my grandparents, Kath and Tony, whose love and support have granted me the privilege of purusing my interests.
