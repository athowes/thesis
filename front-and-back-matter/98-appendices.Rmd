# The First Appendix

This first appendix includes an R chunk that was hidden in the document (using `echo = FALSE`) to help with readibility:

**In 02-rmd-basics-code.Rmd**

```{r ref.label='chunk-parts', eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
```

**And here's another one from the same chapter, i.e. Chapter \@ref(code):**

```{r ref.label='oxford-logo-rotated', eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
```



# The Second Appendix, for Fun
