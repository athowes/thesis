# Troubleshooting

This chapter describes common errors you may run into, and how to fix them.

## Error: Failed to build the bibliography via biber
This can happen if you've had a failed build, perhaps in relation to RStudio shutting down abruptly.

Try doing this:

1. type `make clean-knits` in the terminal tab (or run `file.remove(list.files(pattern = "*.(log|mtc|maf|aux|bbl|blg|xml)"))` in the R console) to clean up files generated by LaTeX during a build
2. restart your computer 

If this does not solve the problem, try using the [natbib](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_management_with_natbib) LaTeX package instead of [biblatex](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Articles/Getting_started_with_BibLaTeX) for handling references.
To do this, go to **index.Rmd** and 

1. set `use-biblatex: false` and `use-natbib: true`
2. set `citation_package: natbib` under 

```yaml
output:
  bookdown::pdf_book:
    citation_package: natbib
```
